CHAPTER 1<br><br><br><br>Loomings.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Call me Ishmael.  Some years ago--never mind how long<br><br>precisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing<br><br>particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a<br><br>little and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have of<br><br>driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.  Whenever I<br><br>find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,<br><br>drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily<br><br>pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every<br><br>funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper<br><br>hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me<br><br>from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking<br><br>people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon<br><br>as I can.  This is my substitute for pistol and ball.  With a<br><br>philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly<br><br>take to the ship.  There is nothing surprising in this.  If they but<br><br>knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish<br><br>very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.<br><br><br><br>There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by<br><br>wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with<br><br>her surf.  Right and left, the streets take you waterward.  Its<br><br>extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by<br><br>waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of<br><br>sight of land.  Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.<br><br><br><br>Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.  Go from<br><br>Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,<br><br>northward.  What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around<br><br>the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean<br><br>reveries.  Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the<br><br>pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some<br><br>high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better<br><br>seaward peep.  But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in<br><br>lath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to<br><br>desks.  How then is this?  Are the green fields gone?  What do they<br><br>here?<br><br><br><br>But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and<br><br>seemingly bound for a dive.  Strange!  Nothing will content them but<br><br>the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of<br><br>yonder warehouses will not suffice.  No.  They must get just as nigh<br><br>the water as they possibly can without falling in.  And there they<br><br>stand--miles of them--leagues.  Inlanders all, they come from lanes<br><br>and alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west.  Yet<br><br>here they all unite.  Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the<br><br>needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?<br><br><br><br>Once more.  Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.<br><br>Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down<br><br>in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.  There is<br><br>magic in it.  Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his<br><br>deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going,<br><br>and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all<br><br>that region.  Should you ever be athirst in the great American<br><br>desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied<br><br>with a metaphysical professor.  Yes, as every one knows, meditation<br><br>and water are wedded for ever.<br><br><br><br>But here is an artist.  He desires to paint you the dreamiest,<br><br>shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all<br><br>the valley of the Saco.  What is the chief element he employs?  There<br><br>stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a<br><br>crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his<br><br>cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.  Deep into<br><br>distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of<br><br>mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.  But though the picture<br><br>lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs<br><br>like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the<br><br>shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.  Go visit<br><br>the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade<br><br>knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm<br><br>wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there!  Were Niagara<br><br>but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see<br><br>it?  Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two<br><br>handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he<br><br>sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway<br><br>Beach?  Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy<br><br>soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?  Why upon your<br><br>first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical<br><br>vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of<br><br>sight of land?  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?  Why did<br><br>the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?  Surely<br><br>all this is not without meaning.  And still deeper the meaning of<br><br>that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the<br><br>tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and<br><br>was drowned.  But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and<br><br>oceans.  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this<br><br>is the key to it all.<br><br><br><br>Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I<br><br>begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of<br><br>my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as<br><br>a passenger.  For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse,<br><br>and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.  Besides,<br><br>passengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do<br><br>not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a<br><br>passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea<br><br>as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.  I abandon the glory and<br><br>distinction of such offices to those who like them.  For my part, I<br><br>abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations<br><br>of every kind whatsoever.  It is quite as much as I can do to take<br><br>care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,<br><br>schooners, and what not.  And as for going as cook,--though I confess<br><br>there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer<br><br>on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though<br><br>once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and<br><br>peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to<br><br>say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.  It is out of the<br><br>idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted<br><br>river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their<br><br>huge bake-houses the pyramids.<br><br><br><br>No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,<br><br>plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.<br><br>True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to<br><br>spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of<br><br>thing is unpleasant enough.  It touches one's sense of honour,<br><br>particularly if you come of an old established family in the land,<br><br>the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And more than<br><br>all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have<br><br>been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys<br><br>stand in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I assure you,<br><br>from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of<br><br>Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.  But even<br><br>this wears off in time.<br><br><br><br>What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a<br><br>broom and sweep down the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,<br><br>weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think<br><br>the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I<br><br>promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular<br><br>instance?  Who ain't a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the<br><br>old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch<br><br>me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;<br><br>that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same<br><br>way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and<br><br>so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each<br><br>other's shoulder-blades, and be content.<br><br><br><br>Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of<br><br>paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single<br><br>penny that I ever heard of.  On the contrary, passengers themselves<br><br>must pay.  And there is all the difference in the world between<br><br>paying and being paid.  The act of paying is perhaps the most<br><br>uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon<br><br>us.  But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?  The urbane activity<br><br>with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering<br><br>that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly<br><br>ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.  Ah! how<br><br>cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!<br><br><br><br>Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome<br><br>exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.  For as in this world,<br><br>head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if<br><br>you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the<br><br>Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from<br><br>the sailors on the forecastle.  He thinks he breathes it first; but<br><br>not so.  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in<br><br>many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect<br><br>it.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea<br><br>as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a<br><br>whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who<br><br>has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and<br><br>influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than<br><br>any one else.  And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,<br><br>formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a<br><br>long time ago.  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo<br><br>between more extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the<br><br>bill must have run something like this:<br><br><br><br><br><br>"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.<br><br>"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.<br><br>"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."<br><br><br><br><br><br>Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,<br><br>the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when<br><br>others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and<br><br>short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in<br><br>farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I<br><br>recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the<br><br>springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under<br><br>various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did,<br><br>besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting<br><br>from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.<br><br><br><br>Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great<br><br>whale himself.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all<br><br>my curiosity.  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his<br><br>island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,<br><br>with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and<br><br>sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.  With other men, perhaps, such<br><br>things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented<br><br>with an everlasting itch for things remote.  I love to sail forbidden<br><br>seas, and land on barbarous coasts.  Not ignoring what is good, I am<br><br>quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would<br><br>they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all<br><br>the inmates of the place one lodges in.<br><br><br><br>By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the<br><br>great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild<br><br>conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into<br><br>my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of<br><br>them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br><br><br>The Carpet-Bag.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my<br><br>arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the good<br><br>city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was a<br><br>Saturday night in December.  Much was I disappointed upon learning<br><br>that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no<br><br>way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.<br><br><br><br>As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop<br><br>at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as<br><br>well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.  For my<br><br>mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because<br><br>there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected<br><br>with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.  Besides<br><br>though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the<br><br>business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is<br><br>now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre<br><br>of this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was<br><br>stranded.  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal<br><br>whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the<br><br>Leviathan?  And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first<br><br>adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported<br><br>cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to<br><br>discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the<br><br>bowsprit?<br><br><br><br>Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before<br><br>me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it<br><br>became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep<br><br>meanwhile.  It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and<br><br>dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the<br><br>place.  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only<br><br>brought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael,<br><br>said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street<br><br>shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with<br><br>the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may<br><br>conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire<br><br>the price, and don't be too particular.<br><br><br><br>With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of "The<br><br>Crossed Harpoons"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there.<br><br>Further on, from the bright red windows of the "Sword-Fish Inn,"<br><br>there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the<br><br>packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the<br><br>congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic<br><br>pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the<br><br>flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles<br><br>of my boots were in a most miserable plight.  Too expensive and<br><br>jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare<br><br>in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.<br><br>But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away from<br><br>before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.  So on I<br><br>went.  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward,<br><br>for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.<br><br><br><br>Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either<br><br>hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a<br><br>tomb.  At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that<br><br>quarter of the town proved all but deserted.  But presently I came to<br><br>a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which<br><br>stood invitingly open.  It had a careless look, as if it were meant<br><br>for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was<br><br>to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.  Ha! thought I, ha, as the<br><br>flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that<br><br>destroyed city, Gomorrah?  But "The Crossed Harpoons," and "The<br><br>Sword-Fish?"--this, then must needs be the sign of "The Trap."<br><br>However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed<br><br>on and opened a second, interior door.<br><br><br><br>It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.  A hundred<br><br>black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black<br><br>Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.  It was a negro church;<br><br>and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the<br><br>weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.  Ha, Ishmael, muttered<br><br>I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The Trap!'<br><br><br><br>Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the<br><br>docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a<br><br>swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly<br><br>representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words<br><br>underneath--"The Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin."<br><br><br><br>Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion,<br><br>thought I.  But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I<br><br>suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.  As the light<br><br>looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and<br><br>the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have<br><br>been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the<br><br>swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought<br><br>that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea<br><br>coffee.<br><br><br><br>It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side<br><br>palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.  It stood on a sharp<br><br>bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse<br><br>howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.  Euroclydon,<br><br>nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with<br><br>his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.  "In judging of that<br><br>tempestuous wind called Euroclydon," says an old writer--of whose<br><br>works I possess the only copy extant--"it maketh a marvellous<br><br>difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where<br><br>the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from<br><br>that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which<br><br>the wight Death is the only glazier."  True enough, thought I, as<br><br>this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest<br><br>well.  Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the<br><br>house.  What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies<br><br>though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.  But it's too<br><br>late to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the<br><br>copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.<br><br>Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for<br><br>his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might<br><br>plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and<br><br>yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon!<br><br>says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one<br><br>afterwards) pooh, pooh!  What a fine frosty night; how Orion<br><br>glitters; what northern lights!  Let them talk of their oriental<br><br>summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of<br><br>making my own summer with my own coals.<br><br><br><br>But what thinks Lazarus?  Can he warm his blue hands by holding them<br><br>up to the grand northern lights?  Would not Lazarus rather be in<br><br>Sumatra than here?  Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise<br><br>along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit<br><br>itself, in order to keep out this frost?<br><br><br><br>Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before<br><br>the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should<br><br>be moored to one of the Moluccas.  Yet Dives himself, he too lives<br><br>like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a<br><br>president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of<br><br>orphans.<br><br><br><br>But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there<br><br>is plenty of that yet to come.  Let us scrape the ice from our<br><br>frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this "Spouter" may be.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 3<br><br><br><br>The Spouter-Inn.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,<br><br>low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of<br><br>the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.  On one side hung a very<br><br>large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,<br><br>that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only<br><br>by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and<br><br>careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an<br><br>understanding of its purpose.  Such unaccountable masses of shades<br><br>and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young<br><br>artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to<br><br>delineate chaos bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest<br><br>contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by<br><br>throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at<br><br>last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might<br><br>not be altogether unwarranted.<br><br><br><br>But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,<br><br>portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the<br><br>picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a<br><br>nameless yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to<br><br>drive a nervous man distracted.  Yet was there a sort of indefinite,<br><br>half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you<br><br>to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out<br><br>what that marvellous painting meant.  Ever and anon a bright, but,<br><br>alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--It's the Black Sea in a<br><br>midnight gale.--It's the unnatural combat of the four primal<br><br>elements.--It's a blasted heath.--It's a Hyperborean winter<br><br>scene.--It's the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.  But at<br><br>last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in<br><br>the picture's midst.  THAT once found out, and all the rest were<br><br>plain.  But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic<br><br>fish? even the great leviathan himself?<br><br><br><br>In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,<br><br>partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with<br><br>whom I conversed upon the subject.  The picture represents a<br><br>Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering<br><br>there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an<br><br>exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in<br><br>the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.<br><br><br><br>The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish<br><br>array of monstrous clubs and spears.  Some were thickly set with<br><br>glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots<br><br>of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping<br><br>round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed<br><br>mower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous<br><br>cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such<br><br>a hacking, horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old<br><br>whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.  Some were<br><br>storied weapons.  With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed,<br><br>fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a<br><br>sunrise and a sunset.  And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was<br><br>flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards<br><br>slain off the Cape of Blanco.  The original iron entered nigh the<br><br>tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,<br><br>travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the<br><br>hump.<br><br><br><br>Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut<br><br>through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with<br><br>fireplaces all round--you enter the public room.  A still duskier<br><br>place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old<br><br>wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some<br><br>old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this<br><br>corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.  On one side stood a<br><br>long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled<br><br>with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks.<br><br>Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking<br><br>den--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale's head.  Be that how it<br><br>may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a<br><br>coach might almost drive beneath it.  Within are shabby shelves,<br><br>ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws<br><br>of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed<br><br>they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their<br><br>money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.<br><br><br><br>Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.  Though<br><br>true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses<br><br>deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.  Parallel<br><br>meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads'<br><br>goblets.  Fill to THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS<br><br>a penny more; and so on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure,<br><br>which you may gulp down for a shilling.<br><br><br><br>Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered<br><br>about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of<br><br>SKRIMSHANDER.  I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be<br><br>accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was<br><br>full--not a bed unoccupied.  "But avast," he added, tapping his<br><br>forehead, "you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket,<br><br>have ye?  I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd better get used<br><br>to that sort of thing."<br><br><br><br>I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should<br><br>ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and<br><br>that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the<br><br>harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander<br><br>further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up<br><br>with the half of any decent man's blanket.<br><br><br><br>"I thought so.  All right; take a seat.  Supper?--you want supper?<br><br>Supper'll be ready directly."<br><br><br><br>I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on<br><br>the Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning<br><br>it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at<br><br>the space between his legs.  He was trying his hand at a ship under<br><br>full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.<br><br><br><br>At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an<br><br>adjoining room.  It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord<br><br>said he couldn't afford it.  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,<br><br>each in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey<br><br>jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half<br><br>frozen fingers.  But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not<br><br>only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for<br><br>supper!  One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to<br><br>these dumplings in a most direful manner.<br><br><br><br>"My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the nightmare to a dead<br><br>sartainty."<br><br><br><br>"Landlord," I whispered, "that aint the harpooneer is it?"<br><br><br><br>"Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, "the<br><br>harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he<br><br>don't--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."<br><br><br><br>"The devil he does," says I.  "Where is that harpooneer?  Is he<br><br>here?"<br><br><br><br>"He'll be here afore long," was the answer.<br><br><br><br>I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this "dark<br><br>complexioned" harpooneer.  At any rate, I made up my mind that if it<br><br>so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get<br><br>into bed before I did.<br><br><br><br>Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not<br><br>what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the<br><br>evening as a looker on.<br><br><br><br>Presently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up, the<br><br>landlord cried, "That's the Grampus's crew.  I seed her reported in<br><br>the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship.<br><br>Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news from the Feegees."<br><br><br><br>A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung<br><br>open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in<br><br>their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen<br><br>comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with<br><br>icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had<br><br>just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they<br><br>entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the<br><br>whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there<br><br>officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained<br><br>of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like<br><br>potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for<br><br>all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,<br><br>or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side<br><br>of an ice-island.<br><br><br><br>The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even<br><br>with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began<br><br>capering about most obstreperously.<br><br><br><br>I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though<br><br>he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his<br><br>own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much<br><br>noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the<br><br>sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though<br><br>but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),<br><br>I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full<br><br>six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a<br><br>coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was<br><br>deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the<br><br>contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some<br><br>reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at<br><br>once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I<br><br>thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the<br><br>Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions<br><br>had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I<br><br>saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few<br><br>minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it<br><br>seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry<br><br>of "Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" and darted out of<br><br>the house in pursuit of him.<br><br><br><br>It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost<br><br>supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate<br><br>myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to<br><br>the entrance of the seamen.<br><br><br><br>No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal<br><br>rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but<br><br>people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes<br><br>to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange<br><br>town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections<br><br>indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a<br><br>sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors<br><br>no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To<br><br>be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your<br><br>own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in<br><br>your own skin.<br><br><br><br>The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the<br><br>thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a<br><br>harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be<br><br>of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all<br><br>over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought<br><br>to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon<br><br>me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been<br><br>coming?<br><br><br><br>"Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't<br><br>sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here."<br><br><br><br>"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a<br><br>mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here"--feeling of the knots<br><br>and notches.  "But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's<br><br>plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough."<br><br>So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief<br><br>first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,<br><br>the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;<br><br>till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.<br><br>The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for<br><br>heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did<br><br>not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a<br><br>pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and<br><br>throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went<br><br>about his business, and left me in a brown study.<br><br><br><br>I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too<br><br>short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too<br><br>narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher<br><br>than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the<br><br>first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,<br><br>leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.<br><br>But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me<br><br>from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at<br><br>all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one<br><br>from the window, and both together formed a series of small<br><br>whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought<br><br>to spend the night.<br><br><br><br>The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I<br><br>steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,<br><br>not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad<br><br>idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell<br><br>but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the<br><br>harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me<br><br>down!<br><br><br><br>Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of<br><br>spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I<br><br>began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable<br><br>prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait<br><br>awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at<br><br>him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after<br><br>all--there's no telling.<br><br><br><br>But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and<br><br>threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.<br><br><br><br>"Landlord! said I, "what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep<br><br>such late hours?"  It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.<br><br><br><br>The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be<br><br>mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  "No," he<br><br>answered, "generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to<br><br>rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he<br><br>went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him<br><br>so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head."<br><br><br><br>"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you<br><br>are telling me?" getting into a towering rage.  "Do you pretend to<br><br>say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed<br><br>Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around<br><br>this town?"<br><br><br><br>"That's precisely it," said the landlord, "and I told him he couldn't<br><br>sell it here, the market's overstocked."<br><br><br><br>"With what?" shouted I.<br><br><br><br>"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?"<br><br><br><br>"I tell you what it is, landlord," said I quite calmly, "you'd better<br><br>stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green."<br><br><br><br>"May be not," taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, "but I<br><br>rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a<br><br>slanderin' his head."<br><br><br><br>"I'll break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again at<br><br>this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.<br><br><br><br>"It's broke a'ready," said he.<br><br><br><br>"Broke," said I--"BROKE, do you mean?"<br><br><br><br>"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess."<br><br><br><br>"Landlord," said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a<br><br>snow-storm--"landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand one<br><br>another, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a<br><br>bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half<br><br>belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I<br><br>have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and<br><br>exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling<br><br>towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of<br><br>connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the<br><br>highest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and<br><br>what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe<br><br>to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so<br><br>good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I<br><br>take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've<br><br>no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,<br><br>landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would<br><br>thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution."<br><br><br><br>"Wall," said the landlord, fetching a long breath, "that's a purty<br><br>long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,<br><br>be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just<br><br>arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New<br><br>Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but<br><br>one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's<br><br>Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' human heads about the<br><br>streets when folks is goin' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,<br><br>but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four<br><br>heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions."<br><br><br><br>This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and<br><br>showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling<br><br>me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who<br><br>stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged<br><br>in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?<br><br><br><br>"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man."<br><br><br><br>"He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder.  "But come, it's getting<br><br>dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed;<br><br>Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's<br><br>plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty<br><br>big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and<br><br>little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling<br><br>about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came<br><br>near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come<br><br>along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;" and so saying he lighted<br><br>a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I<br><br>stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed<br><br>"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come<br><br>to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?"<br><br><br><br>I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I<br><br>was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure<br><br>enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four<br><br>harpooneers to sleep abreast.<br><br><br><br>"There," said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea<br><br>chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; "there,<br><br>make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye."  I turned<br><br>round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.<br><br><br><br>Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of<br><br>the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then<br><br>glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,<br><br>could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude<br><br>shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man<br><br>striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,<br><br>there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one<br><br>corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's<br><br>wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a<br><br>parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the<br><br>fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.<br><br><br><br>But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to<br><br>the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to<br><br>arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare<br><br>it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with<br><br>little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills<br><br>round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of<br><br>this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could<br><br>it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,<br><br>and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?<br><br>I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being<br><br>uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though<br><br>this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I<br><br>went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never<br><br>saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry<br><br>that I gave myself a kink in the neck.<br><br><br><br>I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this<br><br>head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time<br><br>on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then<br><br>stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,<br><br>and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel<br><br>very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the<br><br>landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that<br><br>night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of<br><br>my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into<br><br>bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.<br><br><br><br>Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,<br><br>there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not<br><br>sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had<br><br>pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I<br><br>heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light<br><br>come into the room from under the door.<br><br><br><br>Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal<br><br>head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a<br><br>word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical<br><br>New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and<br><br>without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off<br><br>from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at<br><br>the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the<br><br>room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted<br><br>for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This<br><br>accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a<br><br>sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here<br><br>and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's<br><br>just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,<br><br>got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at<br><br>that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I<br><br>plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black<br><br>squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At<br><br>first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the<br><br>truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a<br><br>whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by<br><br>them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant<br><br>voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,<br><br>thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in<br><br>any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly<br><br>complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and<br><br>completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it<br><br>might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never<br><br>heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.<br><br>However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun<br><br>there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while<br><br>all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this<br><br>harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty<br><br>having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently<br><br>pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair<br><br>on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he<br><br>then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed<br><br>it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver<br><br>hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no<br><br>hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small<br><br>scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now<br><br>looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger<br><br>stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker<br><br>than ever I bolted a dinner.<br><br><br><br>Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,<br><br>but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make<br><br>of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my<br><br>comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely<br><br>nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as<br><br>much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken<br><br>into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him<br><br>that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a<br><br>satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.<br><br><br><br>Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last<br><br>showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him<br><br>were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was<br><br>all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty<br><br>Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.<br><br>Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green<br><br>frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite<br><br>plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard<br><br>of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian<br><br>country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps<br><br>the heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to<br><br>mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!<br><br><br><br>But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about<br><br>something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me<br><br>that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or<br><br>wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he<br><br>fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little<br><br>deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a<br><br>three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first<br><br>I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved<br><br>in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,<br><br>and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded<br><br>that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to<br><br>be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing<br><br>the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like<br><br>a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks<br><br>inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very<br><br>appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.<br><br><br><br>I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but<br><br>ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes<br><br>about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and<br><br>places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship<br><br>biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the<br><br>shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty<br><br>snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers<br><br>(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded<br><br>in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a<br><br>little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the<br><br>little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he<br><br>never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by<br><br>still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be<br><br>praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,<br><br>during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.<br><br>At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very<br><br>unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as<br><br>carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.<br><br><br><br>All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and<br><br>seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business<br><br>operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,<br><br>now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in<br><br>which I had so long been bound.<br><br><br><br>But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal<br><br>one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of<br><br>it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth<br><br>at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next<br><br>moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk<br><br>between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not<br><br>help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began<br><br>feeling me.<br><br><br><br>Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him<br><br>against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might<br><br>be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But<br><br>his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill<br><br>comprehended my meaning.<br><br><br><br>"Who-e debel you?"--he at last said--"you no speak-e, dam-me, I<br><br>kill-e."  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about<br><br>me in the dark.<br><br><br><br>"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!" shouted I.  "Landlord!<br><br>Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!"<br><br><br><br>"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!" again growled<br><br>the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered<br><br>the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on<br><br>fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the<br><br>room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.<br><br><br><br>"Don't be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "Queequeg here<br><br>wouldn't harm a hair of your head."<br><br><br><br>"Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you tell me that<br><br>that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"<br><br><br><br>"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads<br><br>around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look<br><br>here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?"<br><br><br><br>"Me sabbee plenty"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and<br><br>sitting up in bed.<br><br><br><br>"You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and<br><br>throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a<br><br>civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a<br><br>moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely<br><br>looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,<br><br>thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has<br><br>just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.<br><br>Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.<br><br><br><br>"Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,<br><br>or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I<br><br>will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed<br><br>with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured."<br><br><br><br>This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely<br><br>motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to<br><br>say--I won't touch a leg of ye."<br><br><br><br>"Good night, landlord," said I, "you may go."<br><br><br><br>I turned in, and never slept better in my life.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 4<br><br><br><br>The Counterpane.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm<br><br>thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had<br><br>almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of<br><br>patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;<br><br>and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan<br><br>labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise<br><br>shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically<br><br>in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various<br><br>times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a<br><br>strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as<br><br>the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the<br><br>quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the<br><br>sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was<br><br>hugging me.<br><br><br><br>My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was<br><br>a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell<br><br>me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely<br><br>settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper<br><br>or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had<br><br>seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,<br><br>somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed<br><br>supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and<br><br>packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon<br><br>of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I<br><br>felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went<br><br>to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as<br><br>possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the<br><br>sheets.<br><br><br><br>I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must<br><br>elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!<br><br>the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;<br><br>the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in<br><br>the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt<br><br>worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in<br><br>my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw<br><br>myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a<br><br>good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning<br><br>me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the<br><br>best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to<br><br>my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great<br><br>deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest<br><br>subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled<br><br>nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in<br><br>dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped<br><br>in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my<br><br>frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a<br><br>supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the<br><br>counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,<br><br>to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.<br><br>For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most<br><br>awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that<br><br>if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be<br><br>broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from<br><br>me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and<br><br>for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding<br><br>attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often<br><br>puzzle myself with it.<br><br><br><br>Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the<br><br>supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,<br><br>to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan<br><br>arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events<br><br>soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only<br><br>alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his<br><br>arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still<br><br>hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.<br><br>I now strove to rouse him--"Queequeg!"--but his only answer was a<br><br>snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a<br><br>horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the<br><br>counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as<br><br>if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;<br><br>abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a<br><br>tomahawk!  "Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!"  At<br><br>length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant<br><br>expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male<br><br>in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;<br><br>and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a<br><br>Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a<br><br>pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not<br><br>altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim<br><br>consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning<br><br>over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious<br><br>misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a<br><br>creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the<br><br>character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to<br><br>the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and<br><br>sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress<br><br>first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole<br><br>apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,<br><br>this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages<br><br>have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous<br><br>how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to<br><br>Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and<br><br>consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him<br><br>from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my<br><br>curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man<br><br>like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well<br><br>worth unusual regarding.<br><br><br><br>He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall<br><br>one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his<br><br>boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his<br><br>next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under<br><br>the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I<br><br>inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of<br><br>propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private<br><br>when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature<br><br>in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was<br><br>just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest<br><br>possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an<br><br>undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very<br><br>probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,<br><br>if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of<br><br>getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his<br><br>hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began<br><br>creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed<br><br>to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made<br><br>to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off<br><br>of a bitter cold morning.<br><br><br><br>Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the<br><br>street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view<br><br>into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that<br><br>Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots<br><br>on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet<br><br>somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as<br><br>possible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that<br><br>time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but<br><br>Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his<br><br>ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his<br><br>waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand<br><br>centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.<br><br>I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he<br><br>takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden<br><br>stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and<br><br>striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous<br><br>scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,<br><br>this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I<br><br>wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine<br><br>steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the<br><br>long straight edges are always kept.<br><br><br><br>The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out<br><br>of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and<br><br>sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 5<br><br><br><br>Breakfast.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted<br><br>the grinning landlord very pleasantly.  I cherished no malice towards<br><br>him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter<br><br>of my bedfellow.<br><br><br><br>However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a<br><br>good thing; the more's the pity.  So, if any one man, in his own<br><br>proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not<br><br>be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be<br><br>spent in that way.  And the man that has anything bountifully<br><br>laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you<br><br>perhaps think for.<br><br><br><br>The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in<br><br>the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.<br><br>They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and<br><br>third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea<br><br>blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny<br><br>company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing<br><br>monkey jackets for morning gowns.<br><br><br><br>You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.<br><br>This young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue,<br><br>and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three<br><br>days landed from his Indian voyage.  That man next him looks a few<br><br>shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.  In<br><br>the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly<br><br>bleached withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.  But<br><br>who could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various<br><br>tints, seemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in one<br><br>array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.<br><br><br><br>"Grub, ho!" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we<br><br>went to breakfast.<br><br><br><br>They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at<br><br>ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.  Not always, though:<br><br>Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch<br><br>one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.<br><br>But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as<br><br>Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach,<br><br>in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's<br><br>performances--this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best<br><br>mode of attaining a high social polish.  Still, for the most part,<br><br>that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.<br><br><br><br>These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that<br><br>after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear<br><br>some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly<br><br>every man maintained a profound silence.  And not only that, but they<br><br>looked embarrassed.  Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom<br><br>without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the<br><br>high seas--entire strangers to them--and duelled them dead without<br><br>winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of<br><br>the same calling, all of kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly<br><br>at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some<br><br>sheepfold among the Green Mountains.  A curious sight; these bashful<br><br>bears, these timid warrior whalemen!<br><br><br><br>But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head<br><br>of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle.  To be sure I<br><br>cannot say much for his breeding.  His greatest admirer could not<br><br>have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with<br><br>him, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table<br><br>with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the<br><br>beefsteaks towards him.  But THAT was certainly very coolly done by<br><br>him, and every one knows that in most people's estimation, to do<br><br>anything coolly is to do it genteelly.<br><br><br><br>We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here; how he<br><br>eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to<br><br>beefsteaks, done rare.  Enough, that when breakfast was over he<br><br>withdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his<br><br>tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking<br><br>with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 6<br><br><br><br>The Street.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish<br><br>an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a<br><br>civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first<br><br>daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.<br><br><br><br>In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will<br><br>frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from<br><br>foreign parts.  Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean<br><br>mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.  Regent Street<br><br>is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo<br><br>Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives.  But New Bedford<br><br>beats all Water Street and Wapping.  In these last-mentioned haunts<br><br>you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand<br><br>chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry<br><br>on their bones unholy flesh.  It makes a stranger stare.<br><br><br><br>But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans,<br><br>Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the<br><br>whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see<br><br>other sights still more curious, certainly more comical.  There<br><br>weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New<br><br>Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.  They<br><br>are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled<br><br>forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.<br><br>Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came.  In some<br><br>things you would think them but a few hours old.  Look there! that<br><br>chap strutting round the corner.  He wears a beaver hat and<br><br>swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.<br><br>Here comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.<br><br><br><br>No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a<br><br>downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his<br><br>two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.  Now when<br><br>a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a<br><br>distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you<br><br>should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.  In<br><br>bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats;<br><br>straps to his canvas trowsers.  Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will<br><br>burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven,<br><br>straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.<br><br><br><br>But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,<br><br>and bumpkins to show her visitors.  Not at all.  Still New Bedford is<br><br>a queer place.  Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land<br><br>would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast<br><br>of Labrador.  As it is, parts of her back country are enough to<br><br>frighten one, they look so bony.  The town itself is perhaps the<br><br>dearest place to live in, in all New England.  It is a land of oil,<br><br>true enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.<br><br>The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave<br><br>them with fresh eggs.  Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America<br><br>will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more<br><br>opulent, than in New Bedford.  Whence came they? how planted upon<br><br>this once scraggy scoria of a country?<br><br><br><br>Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty<br><br>mansion, and your question will be answered.  Yes; all these brave<br><br>houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and<br><br>Indian oceans.  One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up<br><br>hither from the bottom of the sea.  Can Herr Alexander perform a feat<br><br>like that?<br><br><br><br>In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their<br><br>daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.<br><br>You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they<br><br>say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night<br><br>recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.<br><br><br><br>In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long<br><br>avenues of green and gold.  And in August, high in air, the beautiful<br><br>and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by<br><br>their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.  So omnipotent<br><br>is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced<br><br>bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside<br><br>at creation's final day.<br><br><br><br>And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.<br><br>But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their<br><br>cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.  Elsewhere<br><br>match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell<br><br>me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell<br><br>them miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous<br><br>Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 7<br><br><br><br>The Chapel.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few<br><br>are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or<br><br>Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.  I am sure that<br><br>I did not.<br><br><br><br>Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this<br><br>special errand.  The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to<br><br>driving sleet and mist.  Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the<br><br>cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.<br><br>Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and<br><br>sailors' wives and widows.  A muffled silence reigned, only broken at<br><br>times by the shrieks of the storm.  Each silent worshipper seemed<br><br>purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were<br><br>insular and incommunicable.  The chaplain had not yet arrived; and<br><br>there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing<br><br>several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on<br><br>either side the pulpit.  Three of them ran something like the<br><br>following, but I do not pretend to quote:--<br><br><br><br>SACRED<br><br>TO THE MEMORY<br><br>OF<br><br>JOHN TALBOT,<br><br>Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard,<br><br>Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia,<br><br>November 1st, 1836.<br><br>THIS TABLET<br><br>Is erected to his Memory<br><br>BY HIS<br><br>SISTER.<br><br>_____________<br><br><br><br>SACRED<br><br>TO THE MEMORY<br><br>OF<br><br>ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY,<br><br>NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY,<br><br>AND SAMUEL GLEIG,<br><br>Forming one of the boats' crews<br><br>OF<br><br>THE SHIP ELIZA<br><br>Who were towed out of sight by a Whale,<br><br>On the Off-shore Ground in the<br><br>PACIFIC,<br><br>December 31st, 1839.<br><br>THIS MARBLE<br><br>Is here placed by their surviving<br><br>SHIPMATES.<br><br>_____________<br><br><br><br>SACRED<br><br>TO THE MEMORY<br><br>OF<br><br>The late<br><br>CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY,<br><br>Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a<br><br>Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan,<br><br>AUGUST 3d, 1833.<br><br>THIS TABLET<br><br>Is erected to his Memory<br><br>BY<br><br>HIS WIDOW.<br><br><br><br>Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated<br><br>myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see<br><br>Queequeg near me.  Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was<br><br>a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.  This<br><br>savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance;<br><br>because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was<br><br>not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.  Whether any of<br><br>the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among<br><br>the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded<br><br>accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present<br><br>wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief,<br><br>that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose<br><br>unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically<br><br>caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.<br><br><br><br>Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing<br><br>among flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the<br><br>desolation that broods in bosoms like these.  What bitter blanks in<br><br>those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!  What despair in<br><br>those immovable inscriptions!  What deadly voids and unbidden<br><br>infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and<br><br>refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished<br><br>without a grave.  As well might those tablets stand in the cave of<br><br>Elephanta as here.<br><br><br><br>In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;<br><br>why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no<br><br>tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it<br><br>is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we<br><br>prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle<br><br>him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth;<br><br>why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon<br><br>immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly,<br><br>hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries<br><br>ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we<br><br>nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the<br><br>living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a<br><br>knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.  All these things are<br><br>not without their meanings.<br><br><br><br>But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these<br><br>dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.<br><br><br><br>It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a<br><br>Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky<br><br>light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who<br><br>had gone before me.  Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.  But<br><br>somehow I grew merry again.  Delightful inducements to embark, fine<br><br>chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an<br><br>immortal by brevet.  Yes, there is death in this business of<br><br>whaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into<br><br>Eternity.  But what then?  Methinks we have hugely mistaken this<br><br>matter of Life and Death.  Methinks that what they call my shadow<br><br>here on earth is my true substance.  Methinks that in looking at<br><br>things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun<br><br>through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.<br><br>Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.  In fact take<br><br>my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.  And therefore three<br><br>cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they<br><br>will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 8<br><br><br><br>The Pulpit.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable<br><br>robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back<br><br>upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the<br><br>congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the<br><br>chaplain.  Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the<br><br>whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.  He had been a<br><br>sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had<br><br>dedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,<br><br>Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort<br><br>of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for<br><br>among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild<br><br>gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth<br><br>even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his<br><br>history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the<br><br>utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical<br><br>peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life<br><br>he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,<br><br>and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran<br><br>down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed<br><br>almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had<br><br>absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one<br><br>removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,<br><br>arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.<br><br><br><br>Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a<br><br>regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the<br><br>floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the<br><br>architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and<br><br>finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular<br><br>side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.<br><br>The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome<br><br>pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself<br><br>nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole<br><br>contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no<br><br>means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the<br><br>ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the<br><br>man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly<br><br>sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted<br><br>the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.<br><br><br><br>The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case<br><br>with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were<br><br>of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first<br><br>glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient<br><br>for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.<br><br>For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,<br><br>slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up<br><br>the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving<br><br>him impregnable in his little Quebec.<br><br><br><br>I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.<br><br>Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and<br><br>sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any<br><br>mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober<br><br>reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something<br><br>unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he<br><br>signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward<br><br>worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and<br><br>wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is<br><br>a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a<br><br>perennial well of water within the walls.<br><br><br><br>But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,<br><br>borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble<br><br>cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its<br><br>back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship<br><br>beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and<br><br>snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling<br><br>clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed<br><br>forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of<br><br>radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver<br><br>plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  "Ah,<br><br>noble ship," the angel seemed to say, "beat on, beat on, thou noble<br><br>ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the<br><br>clouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand."<br><br><br><br>Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that<br><br>had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in<br><br>the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a<br><br>projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's<br><br>fiddle-headed beak.<br><br><br><br>What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this<br><br>earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit<br><br>leads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is<br><br>first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.  From<br><br>thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for<br><br>favourable winds.  Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not<br><br>a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 9<br><br><br><br>The Sermon.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority<br><br>ordered the scattered people to condense.  "Starboard gangway,<br><br>there! side away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!<br><br>Midships! midships!"<br><br><br><br>There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a<br><br>still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet again,<br><br>and every eye on the preacher.<br><br><br><br>He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his<br><br>large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and<br><br>offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying<br><br>at the bottom of the sea.<br><br><br><br>This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of<br><br>a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he<br><br>commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards<br><br>the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and<br><br>joy--<br><br><br><br>"The ribs and terrors in the whale,<br><br>Arched over me a dismal gloom,<br><br>While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,<br><br>And lift me deepening down to doom.<br><br><br><br>"I saw the opening maw of hell,<br><br>With endless pains and sorrows there;<br><br>Which none but they that feel can tell--<br><br>Oh, I was plunging to despair.<br><br><br><br>"In black distress, I called my God,<br><br>When I could scarce believe him mine,<br><br>He bowed his ear to my complaints--<br><br>No more the whale did me confine.<br><br><br><br>"With speed he flew to my relief,<br><br>As on a radiant dolphin borne;<br><br>Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone<br><br>The face of my Deliverer God.<br><br><br><br>"My song for ever shall record<br><br>That terrible, that joyful hour;<br><br>I give the glory to my God,<br><br>His all the mercy and the power.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the<br><br>howling of the storm.  A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly<br><br>turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand<br><br>down upon the proper page, said: "Beloved shipmates, clinch the last<br><br>verse of the first chapter of Jonah--'And God had prepared a great<br><br>fish to swallow up Jonah.'"<br><br><br><br>"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is<br><br>one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.<br><br>Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a<br><br>pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!  What a noble thing is that<br><br>canticle in the fish's belly!  How billow-like and boisterously<br><br>grand!  We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the<br><br>kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is<br><br>about us!  But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?<br><br>Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful<br><br>men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.  As sinful men,<br><br>it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,<br><br>hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,<br><br>repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.<br><br>As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in<br><br>his wilful disobedience of the command of God--never mind now what<br><br>that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command.<br><br>But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to<br><br>do--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors<br><br>to persuade.  And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it<br><br>is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God<br><br>consists.<br><br><br><br>"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at<br><br>God, by seeking to flee from Him.  He thinks that a ship made by men<br><br>will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the<br><br>Captains of this earth.  He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and<br><br>seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.  There lurks, perhaps, a<br><br>hitherto unheeded meaning here.  By all accounts Tarshish could have<br><br>been no other city than the modern Cadiz.  That's the opinion of<br><br>learned men.  And where is Cadiz, shipmates?  Cadiz is in Spain; as<br><br>far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in<br><br>those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.<br><br>Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly<br><br>coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more<br><br>than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the<br><br>Straits of Gibraltar.  See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought<br><br>to flee world-wide from God?  Miserable man!  Oh! most contemptible<br><br>and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking<br><br>from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar<br><br>hastening to cross the seas.  So disordered, self-condemning is his<br><br>look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere<br><br>suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a<br><br>deck.  How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,<br><br>valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with<br><br>their adieux.  At last, after much dodging search, he finds the<br><br>Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps<br><br>on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the<br><br>moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil<br><br>eye.  Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and<br><br>confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of<br><br>the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.  In their gamesome<br><br>but still serious way, one whispers to the other--"Jack, he's robbed<br><br>a widow;" or, "Joe, do you mark him; he's a bigamist;" or, "Harry<br><br>lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or<br><br>belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom."  Another runs to<br><br>read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which<br><br>the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the<br><br>apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his<br><br>person.  He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his<br><br>sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their<br><br>hands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his<br><br>boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.  He will<br><br>not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.<br><br>So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be<br><br>the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into<br><br>the cabin.<br><br><br><br>"'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making<br><br>out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?'  Oh! how that harmless<br><br>question mangles Jonah!  For the instant he almost turns to flee<br><br>again.  But he rallies.  'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish;<br><br>how soon sail ye, sir?'  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up<br><br>to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he<br><br>hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.  'We<br><br>sail with the next coming tide,' at last he slowly answered, still<br><br>intently eyeing him.  'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any honest<br><br>man that goes a passenger.'  Ha!  Jonah, that's another stab.  But he<br><br>swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.  'I'll sail with<br><br>ye,'--he says,--'the passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.'<br><br>For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not<br><br>to be overlooked in this history, 'that he paid the fare thereof' ere<br><br>the craft did sail.  And taken with the context, this is full of<br><br>meaning.<br><br><br><br>"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects<br><br>crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.<br><br>In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely,<br><br>and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at<br><br>all frontiers.  So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of<br><br>Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly.  He charges him thrice the<br><br>usual sum; and it's assented to.  Then the Captain knows that Jonah<br><br>is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that<br><br>paves its rear with gold.  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,<br><br>prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to<br><br>find a counterfeit.  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is<br><br>put down for his passage.  'Point out my state-room, Sir,' says Jonah<br><br>now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.'  'Thou lookest like it,' says<br><br>the Captain, 'there's thy room.'  Jonah enters, and would lock the<br><br>door, but the lock contains no key.  Hearing him foolishly fumbling<br><br>there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something<br><br>about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked<br><br>within.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into<br><br>his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on<br><br>his forehead.  The air is close, and Jonah gasps.  Then, in that<br><br>contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah<br><br>feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the<br><br>whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards.<br><br><br><br>"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly<br><br>oscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over towards the<br><br>wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and<br><br>all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity<br><br>with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight<br><br>itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it<br><br>hung.  The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his<br><br>tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful<br><br>fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.  But that<br><br>contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him.  The floor, the<br><br>ceiling, and the side, are all awry.  'Oh! so my conscience hangs in<br><br>me!' he groans, 'straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of<br><br>my soul are all in crookedness!'<br><br><br><br>"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still<br><br>reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of<br><br>the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into<br><br>him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in<br><br>giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed;<br><br>and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over<br><br>him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the<br><br>wound, and there's naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in<br><br>his berth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning<br><br>down to sleep.<br><br><br><br>"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables;<br><br>and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all<br><br>careening, glides to sea.  That ship, my friends, was the first of<br><br>recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah.  But the sea rebels; he<br><br>will not bear the wicked burden.  A dreadful storm comes on, the<br><br>ship is like to break.  But now when the boatswain calls all hands to<br><br>lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;<br><br>when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank<br><br>thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah's head; in all this<br><br>raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.  He sees no black sky<br><br>and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or<br><br>heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open<br><br>mouth is cleaving the seas after him.  Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone<br><br>down into the sides of the ship--a berth in the cabin as I have taken<br><br>it, and was fast asleep.  But the frightened master comes to him, and<br><br>shrieks in his dead ear, 'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!'<br><br>Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his<br><br>feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon<br><br>the sea.  But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow<br><br>leaping over the bulwarks.  Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship,<br><br>and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the<br><br>mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.  And ever, as the<br><br>white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the<br><br>blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing<br><br>high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.<br><br><br><br>"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.  In all his<br><br>cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.  The<br><br>sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,<br><br>and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter<br><br>to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose<br><br>cause this great tempest was upon them.  The lot is Jonah's; that<br><br>discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions.<br><br>'What is thine occupation?  Whence comest thou?  Thy country?  What<br><br>people?  But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.  The<br><br>eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they<br><br>not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another<br><br>answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is<br><br>forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.<br><br><br><br>"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and then--'I fear the Lord the God of<br><br>Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!'  Fear him, O Jonah?<br><br>Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN!  Straightway, he now<br><br>goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more<br><br>and more appalled, but still are pitiful.  For when Jonah, not yet<br><br>supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness<br><br>of his deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him<br><br>and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this<br><br>great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek<br><br>by other means to save the ship.  But all in vain; the indignant gale<br><br>howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the<br><br>other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.<br><br><br><br>"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;<br><br>when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea<br><br>is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth<br><br>water behind.  He goes down in the whirling heart of such a<br><br>masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops<br><br>seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to<br><br>all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.  Then<br><br>Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly.  But observe his<br><br>prayer, and learn a weighty lesson.  For sinful as he is, Jonah does<br><br>not weep and wail for direct deliverance.  He feels that his dreadful<br><br>punishment is just.  He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting<br><br>himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will<br><br>still look towards His holy temple.  And here, shipmates, is true and<br><br>faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for<br><br>punishment.  And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is<br><br>shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.<br><br>Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin<br><br>but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.  Sin not;<br><br>but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah."<br><br><br><br>While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,<br><br>slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,<br><br>when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.<br><br>His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed<br><br>the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from<br><br>off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all<br><br>his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to<br><br>them.<br><br><br><br>There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the<br><br>leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with<br><br>closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.<br><br><br><br>But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head<br><br>lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake<br><br>these words:<br><br><br><br>"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press<br><br>upon me.  I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson<br><br>that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still<br><br>more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.  And now how gladly<br><br>would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there<br><br>where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads<br><br>ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a<br><br>pilot of the living God.  How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or<br><br>speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those<br><br>unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at<br><br>the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to<br><br>escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.  But God is<br><br>everywhere; Tarshish he never reached.  As we have seen, God came<br><br>upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of<br><br>doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the midst of the<br><br>seas,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down,<br><br>and 'the weeds were wrapped about his head,' and all the watery world<br><br>of woe bowled over him.  Yet even then beyond the reach of any<br><br>plummet--'out of the belly of hell'--when the whale grounded upon the<br><br>ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting<br><br>prophet when he cried.  Then God spake unto the fish; and from the<br><br>shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up<br><br>towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and<br><br>earth; and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of<br><br>the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears,<br><br>like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the<br><br>ocean--Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.  And what was that,<br><br>shipmates?  To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood!  That was<br><br>it!<br><br><br><br>"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of<br><br>the living God who slights it.  Woe to him whom this world charms<br><br>from Gospel duty!  Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters<br><br>when God has brewed them into a gale!  Woe to him who seeks to please<br><br>rather than to appal!  Woe to him whose good name is more to him than<br><br>goodness!  Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour!  Woe<br><br>to him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!<br><br>Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching<br><br>to others is himself a castaway!"<br><br><br><br>He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his<br><br>face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out<br><br>with a heavenly enthusiasm,--"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard<br><br>hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of<br><br>that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.  Is not the<br><br>main-truck higher than the kelson is low?  Delight is to him--a far,<br><br>far upward, and inward delight--who against the proud gods and<br><br>commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.<br><br>Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of<br><br>this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him.  Delight is to<br><br>him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and<br><br>destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of<br><br>Senators and Judges.  Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who<br><br>acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a<br><br>patriot to heaven.  Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the<br><br>billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this<br><br>sure Keel of the Ages.  And eternal delight and deliciousness will be<br><br>his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O<br><br>Father!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I<br><br>die.  I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's, or<br><br>mine own.  Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what<br><br>is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?"<br><br><br><br>He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face<br><br>with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had<br><br>departed, and he was left alone in the place.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 10<br><br><br><br>A Bosom Friend.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there<br><br>quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some<br><br>time.  He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on<br><br>the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face<br><br>that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a<br><br>jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to<br><br>himself in his heathenish way.<br><br><br><br>But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon,<br><br>going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his<br><br>lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every<br><br>fiftieth page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly<br><br>around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of<br><br>astonishment.  He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming<br><br>to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count<br><br>more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties<br><br>being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages<br><br>was excited.<br><br><br><br>With much interest I sat watching him.  Savage though he was, and<br><br>hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his<br><br>countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means<br><br>disagreeable.  You cannot hide the soul.  Through all his unearthly<br><br>tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and<br><br>in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of<br><br>a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.  And besides all this,<br><br>there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his<br><br>uncouthness could not altogether maim.  He looked like a man who had<br><br>never cringed and never had had a creditor.  Whether it was, too,<br><br>that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and<br><br>brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,<br><br>this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was<br><br>phrenologically an excellent one.  It may seem ridiculous, but it<br><br>reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular<br><br>busts of him.  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope<br><br>from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two<br><br>long promontories thickly wooded on top.  Queequeg was George<br><br>Washington cannibalistically developed.<br><br><br><br>Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to<br><br>be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my<br><br>presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but<br><br>appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous<br><br>book.  Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the<br><br>night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had<br><br>found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this<br><br>indifference of his very strange.  But savages are strange beings; at<br><br>times you do not know exactly how to take them.  At first they are<br><br>overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a<br><br>Socratic wisdom.  I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at<br><br>all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.  He made<br><br>no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the<br><br>circle of his acquaintances.  All this struck me as mighty singular;<br><br>yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.<br><br>Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of<br><br>Cape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could get there--thrown<br><br>among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet<br><br>Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the<br><br>utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to<br><br>himself.  Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt<br><br>he had never heard there was such a thing as that.  But, perhaps, to<br><br>be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living<br><br>or so striving.  So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives<br><br>himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic<br><br>old woman, he must have "broken his digester."<br><br><br><br>As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that<br><br>mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it<br><br>then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms<br><br>gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,<br><br>solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began<br><br>to be sensible of strange feelings.  I felt a melting in me.  No more<br><br>my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish<br><br>world.  This soothing savage had redeemed it.  There he sat, his very<br><br>indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized<br><br>hypocrisies and bland deceits.  Wild he was; a very sight of sights<br><br>to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.<br><br>And those same things that would have repelled most others, they were<br><br>the very magnets that thus drew me.  I'll try a pagan friend, thought<br><br>I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.  I drew<br><br>my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my<br><br>best to talk with him meanwhile.  At first he little noticed these<br><br>advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night's<br><br>hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be<br><br>bedfellows.  I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,<br><br>perhaps a little complimented.<br><br><br><br>We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to<br><br>him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures<br><br>that were in it.  Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we<br><br>went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to<br><br>be seen in this famous town.  Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,<br><br>producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.  And<br><br>then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping<br><br>it regularly passing between us.<br><br><br><br>If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan's<br><br>breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and<br><br>left us cronies.  He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and<br><br>unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his<br><br>forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that<br><br>henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that we<br><br>were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be.<br><br>In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed<br><br>far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple<br><br>savage those old rules would not apply.<br><br><br><br>After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room<br><br>together.  He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his<br><br>enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some<br><br>thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and<br><br>mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of<br><br>them towards me, and said it was mine.  I was going to remonstrate;<br><br>but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets.  I let<br><br>them stay.  He then went about his evening prayers, took out his<br><br>idol, and removed the paper fireboard.  By certain signs and<br><br>symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well<br><br>knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case<br><br>he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.<br><br><br><br>I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible<br><br>Presbyterian Church.  How then could I unite with this wild idolator<br><br>in worshipping his piece of wood?  But what is worship? thought I.<br><br>Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and<br><br>earth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an<br><br>insignificant bit of black wood?  Impossible!  But what is<br><br>worship?--to do the will of God--THAT is worship.  And what is the<br><br>will of God?--to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man<br><br>to do to me--THAT is the will of God.  Now, Queequeg is my fellow<br><br>man.  And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?  Why,<br><br>unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.<br><br>Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn<br><br>idolator.  So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent<br><br>little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before<br><br>him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and<br><br>went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.<br><br>But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.<br><br><br><br>How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for<br><br>confidential disclosures between friends.  Man and wife, they say,<br><br>there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old<br><br>couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.  Thus,<br><br>then, in our hearts' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving<br><br>pair.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 11<br><br><br><br>Nightgown.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and<br><br>Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs<br><br>over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free<br><br>and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations,<br><br>what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we<br><br>felt like getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down<br><br>the future.<br><br><br><br>Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position<br><br>began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves<br><br>sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the<br><br>head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two<br><br>noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans.  We<br><br>felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of<br><br>doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire<br><br>in the room.  The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily<br><br>warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality<br><br>in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.  Nothing<br><br>exists in itself.  If you flatter yourself that you are all over<br><br>comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to<br><br>be comfortable any more.  But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,<br><br>the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled,<br><br>why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most<br><br>delightfully and unmistakably warm.  For this reason a sleeping<br><br>apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the<br><br>luxurious discomforts of the rich.  For the height of this sort of<br><br>deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and<br><br>your snugness and the cold of the outer air.  Then there you lie like<br><br>the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.<br><br><br><br>We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all<br><br>at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets,<br><br>whether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way<br><br>of always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the<br><br>snugness of being in bed.  Because no man can ever feel his own<br><br>identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were<br><br>indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more<br><br>congenial to our clayey part.  Upon opening my eyes then, and coming<br><br>out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and<br><br>coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, I<br><br>experienced a disagreeable revulsion.  Nor did I at all object to the<br><br>hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light,<br><br>seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong<br><br>desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk.  Be it said, that<br><br>though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed<br><br>the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when<br><br>love once comes to bend them.  For now I liked nothing better than<br><br>to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be<br><br>full of such serene household joy then.  I no more felt unduly<br><br>concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance.  I was only alive<br><br>to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a<br><br>blanket with a real friend.  With our shaggy jackets drawn about our<br><br>shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till<br><br>slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated<br><br>by the flame of the new-lit lamp.<br><br><br><br>Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to<br><br>far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native<br><br>island; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and<br><br>tell it.  He gladly complied.  Though at the time I but ill<br><br>comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when<br><br>I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me<br><br>to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton<br><br>I give.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 12<br><br><br><br>Biographical.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West<br><br>and South.  It is not down in any map; true places never are.<br><br><br><br>When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in<br><br>a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green<br><br>sapling; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong<br><br>desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or<br><br>two.  His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest;<br><br>and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of<br><br>unconquerable warriors.  There was excellent blood in his<br><br>veins--royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal<br><br>propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.<br><br><br><br>A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought a<br><br>passage to Christian lands.  But the ship, having her full complement<br><br>of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's<br><br>influence could prevail.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.  Alone in his<br><br>canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship<br><br>must pass through when she quitted the island.  On one side was a<br><br>coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove<br><br>thickets that grew out into the water.  Hiding his canoe, still<br><br>afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in<br><br>the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like<br><br>a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his<br><br>foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing<br><br>himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and<br><br>swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.<br><br><br><br>In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a<br><br>cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and<br><br>Queequeg budged not.  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his<br><br>wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and<br><br>told him he might make himself at home.  But this fine young<br><br>savage--this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin.<br><br>They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.  But<br><br>like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,<br><br>Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily<br><br>gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.  For at<br><br>bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn<br><br>among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still<br><br>happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they<br><br>were.  But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that<br><br>even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more<br><br>so, than all his father's heathens.  Arrived at last in old Sag<br><br>Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to<br><br>Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,<br><br>poor Queequeg gave it up for lost.  Thought he, it's a wicked world<br><br>in all meridians; I'll die a pagan.<br><br><br><br>And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these<br><br>Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.<br><br>Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.<br><br><br><br>By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and<br><br>having a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and<br><br>gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.  He answered<br><br>no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather<br><br>Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled<br><br>throne of thirty pagan Kings before him.  But by and by, he said, he<br><br>would return,--as soon as he felt himself baptized again.  For the<br><br>nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in<br><br>all four oceans.  They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed<br><br>iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.<br><br><br><br>I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future<br><br>movements.  He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.<br><br>Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed<br><br>him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most<br><br>promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.  He at<br><br>once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same<br><br>vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with<br><br>me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly<br><br>dip into the Potluck of both worlds.  To all this I joyously<br><br>assented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was<br><br>an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great<br><br>usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries<br><br>of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant<br><br>seamen.<br><br><br><br>His story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg<br><br>embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the<br><br>light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very<br><br>soon were sleeping.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 13<br><br><br><br>Wheelbarrow.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a<br><br>barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; using,<br><br>however, my comrade's money.  The grinning landlord, as well as the<br><br>boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had<br><br>sprung up between me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin's cock<br><br>and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me<br><br>concerning the very person whom I now companied with.<br><br><br><br>We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own<br><br>poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went<br><br>down to "the Moss," the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at<br><br>the wharf.  As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg<br><br>so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their<br><br>streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.  But<br><br>we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and<br><br>Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon<br><br>barbs.  I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him<br><br>ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own<br><br>harpoons.  To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I<br><br>hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own<br><br>harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal<br><br>combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.  In short,<br><br>like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows<br><br>armed with their own scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish<br><br>them--even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his<br><br>own harpoon.<br><br><br><br>Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story<br><br>about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.  It was in Sag Harbor.<br><br>The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry<br><br>his heavy chest to his boarding house.  Not to seem ignorant about<br><br>the thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise<br><br>way in which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it;<br><br>lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the<br><br>wharf.  "Why," said I, "Queequeg, you might have known better than<br><br>that, one would think.  Didn't the people laugh?"<br><br><br><br>Upon this, he told me another story.  The people of his island of<br><br>Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant<br><br>water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a<br><br>punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament<br><br>on the braided mat where the feast is held.  Now a certain grand<br><br>merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all<br><br>accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea<br><br>captain--this commander was invited to the wedding feast of<br><br>Queequeg's sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten.  Well;<br><br>when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo<br><br>cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of<br><br>honour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the<br><br>High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's father.  Grace being<br><br>said,--for those people have their grace as well as we--though<br><br>Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to<br><br>our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance<br><br>upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say, being said,<br><br>the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the<br><br>island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers<br><br>into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.  Seeing himself<br><br>placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking<br><br>himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a<br><br>mere island King, especially in the King's own house--the Captain<br><br>coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I<br><br>suppose for a huge finger-glass.  "Now," said Queequeg, "what you<br><br>tink now?--Didn't our people laugh?"<br><br><br><br>At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the<br><br>schooner.  Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river.  On one<br><br>side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered<br><br>trees all glittering in the clear, cold air.  Huge hills and<br><br>mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by<br><br>side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at<br><br>last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with<br><br>blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening<br><br>that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long<br><br>voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a<br><br>third, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is the endlessness,<br><br>yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.<br><br><br><br>Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the<br><br>little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his<br><br>snortings.  How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that<br><br>turnpike earth!--that common highway all over dented with the marks<br><br>of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity<br><br>of the sea which will permit no records.<br><br><br><br>At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.<br><br>His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed<br><br>teeth.  On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to<br><br>the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.<br><br>Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a<br><br>wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land<br><br>tornadoes.  So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the<br><br>plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering<br><br>glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that<br><br>two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man<br><br>were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.  But there<br><br>were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense<br><br>greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure.<br><br>Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his<br><br>back.  I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come.  Dropping his<br><br>harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost<br><br>miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the<br><br>air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow<br><br>landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his<br><br>back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a<br><br>puff.<br><br><br><br>"Capting!  Capting! yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;<br><br>"Capting, Capting, here's the devil."<br><br><br><br>"Hallo, YOU sir," cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking<br><br>up to Queequeg, "what in thunder do you mean by that?  Don't you know<br><br>you might have killed that chap?"<br><br><br><br>"What him say?" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.<br><br><br><br>"He say," said I, "that you came near kill-e that man there,"<br><br>pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.<br><br><br><br>"Kill-e," cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an<br><br>unearthly expression of disdain, "ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;<br><br>Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!"<br><br><br><br>"Look you," roared the Captain, "I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if<br><br>you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye."<br><br><br><br>But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain<br><br>to mind his own eye.  The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had<br><br>parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from<br><br>side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.<br><br>The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept<br><br>overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the<br><br>boom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from right to left, and<br><br>back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant<br><br>seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,<br><br>and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed<br><br>towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower<br><br>jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,<br><br>Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of<br><br>the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,<br><br>and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as<br><br>it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way<br><br>trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and<br><br>while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped<br><br>to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.<br><br>For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing<br><br>his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his<br><br>brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand<br><br>and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had<br><br>gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,<br><br>Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see<br><br>just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes<br><br>more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the<br><br>other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The<br><br>poor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;<br><br>the captain begged his pardon.  From that hour I clove to Queequeg<br><br>like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.<br><br><br><br>Was there ever such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to think that<br><br>he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.<br><br>He only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine<br><br>off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning<br><br>against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to<br><br>be saying to himself--"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all<br><br>meridians.  We cannibals must help these Christians."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 14<br><br><br><br>Nantucket.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after<br><br>a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.<br><br><br><br>Nantucket!  Take out your map and look at it.  See what a real corner<br><br>of the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more<br><br>lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.  Look at it--a mere hillock,<br><br>and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background.  There is more<br><br>sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for<br><br>blotting paper.  Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to<br><br>plant weeds there, they don't grow naturally; that they import Canada<br><br>thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a<br><br>leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried<br><br>about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant<br><br>toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer<br><br>time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day's<br><br>walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like<br><br>Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every<br><br>way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean,<br><br>that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be<br><br>found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles.  But these<br><br>extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.<br><br><br><br>Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was<br><br>settled by the red-men.  Thus goes the legend.  In olden times an<br><br>eagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an<br><br>infant Indian in his talons.  With loud lament the parents saw their<br><br>child borne out of sight over the wide waters.  They resolved to<br><br>follow in the same direction.  Setting out in their canoes, after a<br><br>perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an<br><br>empty ivory casket,--the poor little Indian's skeleton.<br><br><br><br>What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should<br><br>take to the sea for a livelihood!  They first caught crabs and<br><br>quohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for<br><br>mackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured<br><br>cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea,<br><br>explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of<br><br>circumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring's Straits; and in<br><br>all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the<br><br>mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous<br><br>and most mountainous!  That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed<br><br>with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics<br><br>are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!<br><br><br><br>And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing<br><br>from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery<br><br>world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the<br><br>Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did<br><br>Poland.  Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada;<br><br>let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing<br><br>banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the<br><br>Nantucketer's.  For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own<br><br>empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it.  Merchant<br><br>ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even<br><br>pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the<br><br>road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like<br><br>themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless<br><br>deep itself.  The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea;<br><br>he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro<br><br>ploughing it as his own special plantation.  THERE is his home; THERE<br><br>lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though<br><br>it overwhelmed all the millions in China.  He lives on the sea, as<br><br>prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs<br><br>them as chamois hunters climb the Alps.  For years he knows not the<br><br>land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another<br><br>world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.  With the<br><br>landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep<br><br>between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of<br><br>land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very<br><br>pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 15<br><br><br><br>Chowder.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to<br><br>anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no<br><br>business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.  The<br><br>landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea<br><br>Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one<br><br>of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured<br><br>us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.<br><br>In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than<br><br>try pot-luck at the Try Pots.  But the directions he had given us<br><br>about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened<br><br>a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard<br><br>hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that<br><br>done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these<br><br>crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially<br><br>as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse--our<br><br>first point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand, whereas<br><br>I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.<br><br>However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and<br><br>then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at<br><br>last came to something which there was no mistaking.<br><br><br><br>Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears,<br><br>swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an<br><br>old doorway.  The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the<br><br>other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a<br><br>gallows.  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the<br><br>time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague<br><br>misgiving.  A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two<br><br>remaining horns; yes, TWO of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me.<br><br>It's ominous, thinks I.  A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my<br><br>first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's<br><br>chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!<br><br>Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?<br><br><br><br>I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman<br><br>with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,<br><br>under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an<br><br>injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple<br><br>woollen shirt.<br><br><br><br>"Get along with ye," said she to the man, "or I'll be combing ye!"<br><br><br><br>"Come on, Queequeg," said I, "all right.  There's Mrs. Hussey."<br><br><br><br>And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving<br><br>Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.  Upon<br><br>making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,<br><br>postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little<br><br>room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently<br><br>concluded repast, turned round to us and said--"Clam or Cod?"<br><br><br><br>"What's that about Cods, ma'am?" said I, with much politeness.<br><br><br><br>"Clam or Cod?" she repeated.<br><br><br><br>"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?"<br><br>says I, "but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter<br><br>time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?"<br><br><br><br>But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple<br><br>Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear<br><br>nothing but the word "clam," Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door<br><br>leading to the kitchen, and bawling out "clam for two," disappeared.<br><br><br><br>"Queequeg," said I, "do you think that we can make out a supper for<br><br>us both on one clam?"<br><br><br><br>However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the<br><br>apparently cheerless prospect before us.  But when that smoking<br><br>chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.  Oh, sweet<br><br>friends! hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely<br><br>bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted<br><br>pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and<br><br>plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.  Our appetites being<br><br>sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing<br><br>his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being<br><br>surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when<br><br>leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod<br><br>announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.  Stepping to<br><br>the kitchen door, I uttered the word "cod" with great emphasis, and<br><br>resumed my seat.  In a few moments the savoury steam came forth<br><br>again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine<br><br>cod-chowder was placed before us.<br><br><br><br>We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks<br><br>I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?<br><br>What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?  "But<br><br>look, Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl?  Where's your<br><br>harpoon?"<br><br><br><br>Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved<br><br>its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders.  Chowder<br><br>for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till<br><br>you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.  The<br><br>area before the house was paved with clam-shells.  Mrs. Hussey wore a<br><br>polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his<br><br>account books bound in superior old shark-skin.  There was a fishy<br><br>flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till<br><br>one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some<br><br>fishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish<br><br>remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's<br><br>decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.<br><br><br><br>Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey<br><br>concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to<br><br>precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and<br><br>demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers.  "Why<br><br>not? said I; "every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why<br><br>not?"  "Because it's dangerous," says she.  "Ever since young Stiggs<br><br>coming from that unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years<br><br>and a half, with only three barrels of ILE, was found dead in my<br><br>first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I<br><br>allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at<br><br>night.  So, Mr. Queequeg" (for she had learned his name), "I will<br><br>just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning.  But the<br><br>chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?"<br><br><br><br>"Both," says I; "and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of<br><br>variety."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 16<br><br><br><br>The Ship.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.  But to my surprise and<br><br>no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had<br><br>been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little<br><br>god--and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly<br><br>insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among<br><br>the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;<br><br>instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of<br><br>the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed<br><br>befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a<br><br>vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light<br><br>upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in<br><br>that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present<br><br>irrespective of Queequeg.<br><br><br><br>I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed<br><br>great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising<br><br>forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a<br><br>rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the<br><br>whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.<br><br><br><br>Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the<br><br>selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all.  I had not a<br><br>little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best<br><br>fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my<br><br>remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to<br><br>acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a<br><br>determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly<br><br>settle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving<br><br>Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that<br><br>it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,<br><br>and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could<br><br>find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never<br><br>could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--leaving Queequeg,<br><br>then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his<br><br>sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.<br><br>After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt<br><br>that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The<br><br>Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I do not know<br><br>the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt<br><br>remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts<br><br>Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about<br><br>the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,<br><br>going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then<br><br>decided that this was the very ship for us.<br><br><br><br>You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I<br><br>know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box<br><br>galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a<br><br>rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the<br><br>old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned<br><br>claw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the<br><br>typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was<br><br>darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and<br><br>Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut<br><br>somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost<br><br>overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of<br><br>the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and<br><br>wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury<br><br>Cathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,<br><br>were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild<br><br>business that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old<br><br>Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another<br><br>vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal<br><br>owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his<br><br>chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid<br><br>it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,<br><br>unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or<br><br>bedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,<br><br>his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of<br><br>trophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the<br><br>chased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open<br><br>bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp<br><br>teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old<br><br>hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks<br><br>of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.<br><br>Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a<br><br>tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the<br><br>long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who<br><br>steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he<br><br>holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but<br><br>somehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are touched with that.<br><br><br><br>Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having<br><br>authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,<br><br>at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort<br><br>of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It<br><br>seemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical<br><br>shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of<br><br>limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws<br><br>of the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a<br><br>circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each<br><br>other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose<br><br>hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old<br><br>Pottowottamie Sachem's head.  A triangular opening faced towards the<br><br>bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view<br><br>forward.<br><br><br><br>And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who<br><br>by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and<br><br>the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden<br><br>of command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling<br><br>all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of<br><br>a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was<br><br>constructed.<br><br><br><br>There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance<br><br>of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old<br><br>seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker<br><br>style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the<br><br>minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen<br><br>from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to<br><br>windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become<br><br>pursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.<br><br><br><br>"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?" said I, advancing to the door of<br><br>the tent.<br><br><br><br>"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of<br><br>him?" he demanded.<br><br><br><br>"I was thinking of shipping."<br><br><br><br>"Thou wast, wast thou?  I see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in<br><br>a stove boat?"<br><br><br><br>"No, Sir, I never have."<br><br><br><br>"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?<br><br><br><br>"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.  I've been<br><br>several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--"<br><br><br><br>"Merchant service be damned.  Talk not that lingo to me.  Dost see<br><br>that leg?--I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou<br><br>talkest of the marchant service to me again.  Marchant service<br><br>indeed!  I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in<br><br>those marchant ships.  But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a<br><br>whaling, eh?--it looks a little suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not<br><br>been a pirate, hast thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst<br><br>thou?--Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to<br><br>sea?"<br><br><br><br>I protested my innocence of these things.  I saw that under the mask<br><br>of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated<br><br>Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather<br><br>distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the<br><br>Vineyard.<br><br><br><br>"But what takes thee a-whaling?  I want to know that before I think<br><br>of shipping ye."<br><br><br><br>"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.  I want to see the world."<br><br><br><br>"Want to see what whaling is, eh?  Have ye clapped eye on Captain<br><br>Ahab?"<br><br><br><br>"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?"<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye, I thought so.  Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship."<br><br><br><br>"I am mistaken then.  I thought I was speaking to the Captain<br><br>himself."<br><br><br><br>"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that's who ye are speaking to,<br><br>young man.  It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod<br><br>fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including<br><br>crew.  We are part owners and agents.  But as I was going to say, if<br><br>thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can<br><br>put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past<br><br>backing out.  Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find<br><br>that he has only one leg."<br><br><br><br>"What do you mean, sir?  Was the other one lost by a whale?"<br><br><br><br>"Lost by a whale!  Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,<br><br>chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped<br><br>a boat!--ah, ah!"<br><br><br><br>I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched<br><br>at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly<br><br>as I could, "What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could<br><br>I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,<br><br>though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of<br><br>the accident."<br><br><br><br>"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou<br><br>dost not talk shark a bit.  SURE, ye've been to sea before now; sure<br><br>of that?"<br><br><br><br>"Sir," said I, "I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in<br><br>the merchant--"<br><br><br><br>"Hard down out of that!  Mind what I said about the marchant<br><br>service--don't aggravate me--I won't have it.  But let us understand<br><br>each other.  I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye<br><br>yet feel inclined for it?"<br><br><br><br>"I do, sir."<br><br><br><br>"Very good.  Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live<br><br>whale's throat, and then jump after it?  Answer, quick!"<br><br><br><br>"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to<br><br>be got rid of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact."<br><br><br><br>"Good again.  Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to<br><br>find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in<br><br>order to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?  I thought so.<br><br>Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the<br><br>weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there."<br><br><br><br>For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not<br><br>knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.<br><br>But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg<br><br>started me on the errand.<br><br><br><br>Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the<br><br>ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely<br><br>pointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but<br><br>exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that<br><br>I could see.<br><br><br><br>"Well, what's the report?" said Peleg when I came back; "what did ye<br><br>see?"<br><br><br><br>"Not much," I replied--"nothing but water; considerable horizon<br><br>though, and there's a squall coming up, I think."<br><br><br><br>"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to<br><br>go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can't ye see the world<br><br>where you stand?"<br><br><br><br>I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and<br><br>the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all<br><br>this I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed<br><br>his willingness to ship me.<br><br><br><br>"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off," he added--"come<br><br>along with ye."  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the<br><br>cabin.<br><br><br><br>Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and<br><br>surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along<br><br>with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the<br><br>other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by<br><br>a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery<br><br>wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of<br><br>plank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest<br><br>their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in<br><br>approved state stocks bringing in good interest.<br><br><br><br>Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a<br><br>Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and<br><br>to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure<br><br>the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously<br><br>modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of<br><br>these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and<br><br>whale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a<br><br>vengeance.<br><br><br><br>So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with<br><br>Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in<br><br>childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of<br><br>the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless<br><br>adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these<br><br>unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not<br><br>unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And<br><br>when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,<br><br>with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the<br><br>stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest<br><br>waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been<br><br>led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all<br><br>nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin<br><br>voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some<br><br>help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty<br><br>language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--a mighty<br><br>pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all<br><br>detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other<br><br>circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness<br><br>at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made<br><br>so through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,<br><br>all mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do<br><br>with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if<br><br>indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the<br><br>Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.<br><br><br><br>Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired<br><br>whaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what<br><br>are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious<br><br>things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been<br><br>originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket<br><br>Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many<br><br>unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not<br><br>moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as<br><br>altered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,<br><br>was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain<br><br>Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms<br><br>against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the<br><br>Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet<br><br>had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of<br><br>leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,<br><br>the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do<br><br>not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably<br><br>he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a<br><br>man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.<br><br>This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short<br><br>clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied<br><br>waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,<br><br>and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded<br><br>his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the<br><br>goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet<br><br>receiving of his well-earned income.<br><br><br><br>Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an<br><br>incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard<br><br>task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a<br><br>curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his<br><br>crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the<br><br>hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially<br><br>for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the<br><br>least.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but<br><br>somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work<br><br>out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured<br><br>eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till<br><br>you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to<br><br>work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and<br><br>idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact<br><br>embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he<br><br>carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,<br><br>economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.<br><br><br><br>Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I<br><br>followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the<br><br>decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always<br><br>sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His<br><br>broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his<br><br>drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he<br><br>seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.<br><br><br><br>"Bildad," cried Captain Peleg, "at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have<br><br>been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my<br><br>certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?"<br><br><br><br>As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,<br><br>Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,<br><br>and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.<br><br><br><br>"He says he's our man, Bildad," said Peleg, "he wants to ship."<br><br><br><br>"Dost thee?" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.<br><br><br><br>"I dost," said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.<br><br><br><br>"What do ye think of him, Bildad?" said Peleg.<br><br><br><br>"He'll do," said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at<br><br>his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.<br><br><br><br>I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as<br><br>Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I<br><br>said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a<br><br>chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink<br><br>before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think<br><br>it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be<br><br>willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the<br><br>whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the<br><br>captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that<br><br>these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining<br><br>to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware<br><br>that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very<br><br>large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a<br><br>ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I<br><br>had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the<br><br>275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that<br><br>might eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they<br><br>call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had<br><br>a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear<br><br>out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which<br><br>I would not have to pay one stiver.<br><br><br><br>It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely<br><br>fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of<br><br>those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite<br><br>content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am<br><br>putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I<br><br>thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not<br><br>have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was<br><br>of a broad-shouldered make.<br><br><br><br>But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about<br><br>receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had<br><br>heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony<br><br>Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,<br><br>therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,<br><br>left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.<br><br>And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty<br><br>deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on<br><br>board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his<br><br>Bible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying<br><br>to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small<br><br>surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these<br><br>proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself<br><br>out of his book, "LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,<br><br>where moth--"<br><br><br><br>"Well, Captain Bildad," interrupted Peleg, "what d'ye say, what lay<br><br>shall we give this young man?"<br><br><br><br>"Thou knowest best," was the sepulchral reply, "the seven hundred and<br><br>seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust<br><br>do corrupt, but LAY--'"<br><br><br><br>LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and<br><br>seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for<br><br>one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do<br><br>corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though<br><br>from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a<br><br>landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven<br><br>hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you<br><br>come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven<br><br>hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less<br><br>than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought<br><br>at the time.<br><br><br><br>"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad," cried Peleg, "thou dost not want to<br><br>swindle this young man! he must have more than that."<br><br><br><br>"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh," again said Bildad, without<br><br>lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--"for where your treasure<br><br>is, there will your heart be also."<br><br><br><br>"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth," said Peleg, "do<br><br>ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say."<br><br><br><br>Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,<br><br>"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider<br><br>the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and<br><br>orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the<br><br>labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those<br><br>widows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,<br><br>Captain Peleg."<br><br><br><br>"Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the<br><br>cabin.  "Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in<br><br>these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that<br><br>would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed<br><br>round Cape Horn."<br><br><br><br>"Captain Peleg," said Bildad steadily, "thy conscience may be drawing<br><br>ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art<br><br>still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy<br><br>conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee<br><br>foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg."<br><br><br><br>"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,<br><br>ye insult me.  It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature<br><br>that he's bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again<br><br>to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a<br><br>live goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye<br><br>canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!"<br><br><br><br>As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a<br><br>marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded<br><br>him.<br><br><br><br>Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and<br><br>responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up<br><br>all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily<br><br>commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,<br><br>who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the<br><br>awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again<br><br>on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest<br><br>intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg<br><br>and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,<br><br>there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,<br><br>though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  "Whew!"<br><br>he whistled at last--"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think.<br><br>Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,<br><br>will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That's he; thank<br><br>ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye<br><br>say?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth<br><br>lay."<br><br><br><br>"Captain Peleg," said I, "I have a friend with me who wants to ship<br><br>too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?"<br><br><br><br>"To be sure," said Peleg.  "Fetch him along, and we'll look at him."<br><br><br><br>"What lay does he want?" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book<br><br>in which he had again been burying himself.<br><br><br><br>"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad," said Peleg.  "Has he ever<br><br>whaled it any?" turning to me.<br><br><br><br>"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg."<br><br><br><br>"Well, bring him along then."<br><br><br><br>And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that<br><br>I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the<br><br>identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round<br><br>the Cape.<br><br><br><br>But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the<br><br>Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,<br><br>indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,<br><br>and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself<br><br>visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are<br><br>so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,<br><br>that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of<br><br>that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,<br><br>but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it<br><br>is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing<br><br>yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,<br><br>inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.<br><br><br><br>"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;<br><br>thou art shipped."<br><br><br><br>"Yes, but I should like to see him."<br><br><br><br>"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know<br><br>exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the<br><br>house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't<br><br>sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't<br><br>always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,<br><br>Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him<br><br>well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,<br><br>Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you<br><br>may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;<br><br>Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to<br><br>deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,<br><br>stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest<br><br>that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he<br><br>ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,<br><br>was a crowned king!"<br><br><br><br>"And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did<br><br>they not lick his blood?"<br><br><br><br>"Come hither to me--hither, hither," said Peleg, with a significance<br><br>in his eye that almost startled me.  "Look ye, lad; never say that on<br><br>board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name<br><br>himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed<br><br>mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old<br><br>squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove<br><br>prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the<br><br>same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;<br><br>I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good<br><br>man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good<br><br>man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,<br><br>aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the<br><br>passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was<br><br>the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that<br><br>about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost<br><br>his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of<br><br>moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass<br><br>off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,<br><br>it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad<br><br>one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he<br><br>happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not<br><br>three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that<br><br>sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any<br><br>utter, hopeless harm in Ahab?  No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if<br><br>he be, Ahab has his humanities!"<br><br><br><br>As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been<br><br>incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain<br><br>wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, at the<br><br>time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know<br><br>what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a<br><br>strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all<br><br>describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was.  But I felt<br><br>it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt<br><br>impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he<br><br>was known to me then.  However, my thoughts were at length carried in<br><br>other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 17<br><br><br><br>The Ramadan.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue<br><br>all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for<br><br>I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious<br><br>obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my<br><br>heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a<br><br>toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,<br><br>who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,<br><br>bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on<br><br>account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his<br><br>name.<br><br><br><br>I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these<br><br>things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,<br><br>pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these<br><br>subjects.  There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most<br><br>absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that?<br><br>Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to<br><br>be content; and there let him rest.  All our arguing with him would<br><br>not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us<br><br>all--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow<br><br>dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.<br><br><br><br>Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and<br><br>rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;<br><br>but no answer.  I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.<br><br>"Queequeg," said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.  "I say,<br><br>Queequeg! why don't you speak?  It's I--Ishmael."  But all remained<br><br>still as before.  I began to grow alarmed.  I had allowed him such<br><br>abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.  I<br><br>looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner<br><br>of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister<br><br>one.  I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line<br><br>of the wall, but nothing more.  I was surprised to behold resting<br><br>against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the<br><br>landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting<br><br>to the chamber.  That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since<br><br>the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without<br><br>it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.<br><br><br><br>"Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all still.  Something must have happened.<br><br>Apoplexy!  I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly<br><br>resisted.  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the<br><br>first person I met--the chamber-maid.  "La! la!" she cried, "I<br><br>thought something must be the matter.  I went to make the bed after<br><br>breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and<br><br>it's been just so silent ever since.  But I thought, may be, you had<br><br>both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping.  La! la,<br><br>ma'am!--Mistress! murder!  Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!"--and with these<br><br>cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.<br><br><br><br>Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a<br><br>vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the<br><br>occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black<br><br>boy meantime.<br><br><br><br>"Wood-house!" cried I, "which way to it?  Run for God's sake, and<br><br>fetch something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a<br><br>stroke; depend upon it!"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing<br><br>up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the<br><br>mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her<br><br>countenance.<br><br><br><br>"What's the matter with you, young man?"<br><br><br><br>"Get the axe!  For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I<br><br>pry it open!"<br><br><br><br>"Look here," said the landlady, quickly putting down the<br><br>vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; "look here; are you<br><br>talking about prying open any of my doors?"--and with that she seized<br><br>my arm.  "What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you,<br><br>shipmate?"<br><br><br><br>In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand<br><br>the whole case.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side<br><br>of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--"No!  I<br><br>haven't seen it since I put it there."  Running to a little closet<br><br>under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told<br><br>me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing.  "He's killed himself," she<br><br>cried.  "It's unfort'nate Stiggs done over again there goes another<br><br>counterpane--God pity his poor mother!--it will be the ruin of my<br><br>house.  Has the poor lad a sister?  Where's that girl?--there, Betty,<br><br>go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with--"no<br><br>suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;"--might as<br><br>well kill both birds at once.  Kill?  The Lord be merciful to his<br><br>ghost!  What's that noise there?  You, young man, avast there!"<br><br><br><br>And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force<br><br>open the door.<br><br><br><br>"I don't allow it; I won't have my premises spoiled.  Go for the<br><br>locksmith, there's one about a mile from here.  But avast!" putting<br><br>her hand in her side-pocket, "here's a key that'll fit, I guess;<br><br>let's see."  And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas!<br><br>Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.<br><br><br><br>"Have to burst it open," said I, and was running down the entry a<br><br>little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again<br><br>vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and<br><br>with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.<br><br><br><br>With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming<br><br>against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good<br><br>heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected;<br><br>right in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding<br><br>Yojo on top of his head.  He looked neither one way nor the other<br><br>way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.<br><br><br><br>"Queequeg," said I, going up to him, "Queequeg, what's the matter<br><br>with you?"<br><br><br><br>"He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?" said the landlady.<br><br><br><br>But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt<br><br>like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was<br><br>almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally<br><br>constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so<br><br>for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular<br><br>meals.<br><br><br><br>"Mrs. Hussey," said I, "he's ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you<br><br>please, and I will see to this strange affair myself."<br><br><br><br>Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon<br><br>Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain.  There he sat; and all he<br><br>could do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move<br><br>a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my<br><br>presence in the slightest way.<br><br><br><br>I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan;<br><br>do they fast on their hams that way in his native island.  It must be<br><br>so; yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him<br><br>rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no doubt.  It can't last for<br><br>ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't<br><br>believe it's very punctual then.<br><br><br><br>I went down to supper.  After sitting a long time listening to the<br><br>long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding<br><br>voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a<br><br>schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic<br><br>Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly<br><br>eleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by<br><br>this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a<br><br>termination.  But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had<br><br>not stirred an inch.  I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so<br><br>downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half<br><br>the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his<br><br>head.<br><br><br><br>"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and<br><br>have some supper.  You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg."<br><br>But not a word did he reply.<br><br><br><br>Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;<br><br>and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.  But previous<br><br>to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over<br><br>him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but<br><br>his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could<br><br>not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the<br><br>mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that<br><br>uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me<br><br>really wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room<br><br>with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable<br><br>Ramadan!<br><br><br><br>But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break<br><br>of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as<br><br>if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first<br><br>glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating<br><br>joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;<br><br>pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was<br><br>over.<br><br><br><br>Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's<br><br>religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or<br><br>insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it<br><br>also.  But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a<br><br>positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an<br><br>uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that<br><br>individual aside and argue the point with him.<br><br><br><br>And just so I now did with Queequeg.  "Queequeg," said I, "get into<br><br>bed now, and lie and listen to me."  I then went on, beginning with<br><br>the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to<br><br>the various religions of the present time, during which time I<br><br>labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and<br><br>prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark<br><br>nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in<br><br>short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,<br><br>too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and<br><br>sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now<br><br>so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,<br><br>argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;<br><br>and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.<br><br>This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such<br><br>melancholy notions about their hereafters.  In one word, Queequeg,<br><br>said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an<br><br>undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the<br><br>hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.<br><br><br><br>I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with<br><br>dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it<br><br>in.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a<br><br>great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great<br><br>battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two<br><br>o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.<br><br><br><br>"No more, Queequeg," said I, shuddering; "that will do;" for I knew<br><br>the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor<br><br>who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the<br><br>custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all<br><br>the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,<br><br>they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like<br><br>a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in<br><br>their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all<br><br>his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas<br><br>turkeys.<br><br><br><br>After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much<br><br>impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow<br><br>seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered<br><br>from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more<br><br>than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,<br><br>finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true<br><br>religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending<br><br>concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that<br><br>such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical<br><br>pagan piety.<br><br><br><br>At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously<br><br>hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady<br><br>should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out<br><br>to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with<br><br>halibut bones.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 18<br><br><br><br>His Mark.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship,<br><br>Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice<br><br>loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my<br><br>friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no<br><br>cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their<br><br>papers.<br><br><br><br>"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?" said I, now jumping on the<br><br>bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.<br><br><br><br>"I mean," he replied, "he must show his papers."<br><br><br><br>"Yes," said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head<br><br>from behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam.  "He must show that he's<br><br>converted.  Son of darkness," he added, turning to Queequeg, "art<br><br>thou at present in communion with any Christian church?"<br><br><br><br>"Why," said I, "he's a member of the first Congregational Church."<br><br>Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket<br><br>ships at last come to be converted into the churches.<br><br><br><br>"First Congregational Church," cried Bildad, "what! that worships in<br><br>Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?" and so saying, taking<br><br>out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana<br><br>handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the<br><br>wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look<br><br>at Queequeg.<br><br><br><br>"How long hath he been a member?" he then said, turning to me; "not<br><br>very long, I rather guess, young man."<br><br><br><br>"No," said Peleg, "and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it<br><br>would have washed some of that devil's blue off his face."<br><br><br><br>"Do tell, now," cried Bildad, "is this Philistine a regular member of<br><br>Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting?  I never saw him going there, and I<br><br>pass it every Lord's day."<br><br><br><br>"I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting," said<br><br>I; "all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First<br><br>Congregational Church.  He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is."<br><br><br><br>"Young man," said Bildad sternly, "thou art skylarking with<br><br>me--explain thyself, thou young Hittite.  What church dost thee mean?<br><br>answer me."<br><br><br><br>Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied.  "I mean, sir, the same<br><br>ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,<br><br>and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of<br><br>us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole<br><br>worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish<br><br>some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in THAT we<br><br>all join hands."<br><br><br><br>"Splice, thou mean'st SPLICE hands," cried Peleg, drawing nearer.<br><br>"Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary, instead of a<br><br>fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon.  Deacon<br><br>Deuteronomy--why Father Mapple himself couldn't beat it, and he's<br><br>reckoned something.  Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the<br><br>papers.  I say, tell Quohog there--what's that you call him? tell<br><br>Quohog to step along.  By the great anchor, what a harpoon he's got<br><br>there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right.  I<br><br>say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head<br><br>of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?"<br><br><br><br>Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon<br><br>the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats<br><br>hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his<br><br>harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:--<br><br><br><br>"Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere?  You see him?<br><br>well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!" and taking sharp aim at<br><br>it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean<br><br>across the ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of<br><br>sight.<br><br><br><br>"Now," said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, "spos-ee him<br><br>whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead."<br><br><br><br>"Quick, Bildad," said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close<br><br>vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin<br><br>gangway.  "Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship's papers.  We<br><br>must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats.  Look<br><br>ye, Quohog, we'll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that's more than<br><br>ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket."<br><br><br><br>So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon<br><br>enrolled among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.<br><br><br><br>When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready<br><br>for signing, he turned to me and said, "I guess, Quohog there don't<br><br>know how to write, does he?  I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign<br><br>thy name or make thy mark?<br><br><br><br>But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken<br><br>part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the<br><br>offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact<br><br>counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm;<br><br>so that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his<br><br>appellative, it stood something like this:--<br><br><br><br>Quohog.<br><br>his X mark.<br><br><br><br>Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing<br><br>Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge<br><br>pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts,<br><br>and selecting one entitled "The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to<br><br>Lose," placed it in Queequeg's hands, and then grasping them and the<br><br>book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, "Son of<br><br>darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship,<br><br>and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still<br><br>clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee,<br><br>remain not for aye a Belial bondsman.  Spurn the idol Bell, and the<br><br>hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say;<br><br>oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!"<br><br><br><br>Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's language,<br><br>heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.<br><br><br><br>"Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our<br><br>harpooneer," Peleg.  "Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers--it<br><br>takes the shark out of 'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint<br><br>pretty sharkish.  There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest<br><br>boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the<br><br>meeting, and never came to good.  He got so frightened about his<br><br>plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear<br><br>of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones."<br><br><br><br>"Peleg!  Peleg!" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, "thou<br><br>thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,<br><br>Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can'st thou<br><br>prate in this ungodly guise.  Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg.<br><br>Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in<br><br>that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with<br><br>Captain Ahab, did'st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?"<br><br><br><br>"Hear him, hear him now," cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and<br><br>thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,--"hear him, all of ye.<br><br>Think of that!  When every moment we thought the ship would sink!<br><br>Death and the Judgment then?  What?  With all three masts making such<br><br>an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking<br><br>over us, fore and aft.  Think of Death and the Judgment then?  No!<br><br>no time to think about Death then.  Life was what Captain Ahab and I<br><br>was thinking of; and how to save all hands--how to rig<br><br>jury-masts--how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was<br><br>thinking of."<br><br><br><br>Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,<br><br>where we followed him.  There he stood, very quietly overlooking some<br><br>sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist.  Now and then he<br><br>stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which<br><br>otherwise might have been wasted.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 19<br><br><br><br>The Prophet.<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?"<br><br><br><br>Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from<br><br>the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when<br><br>the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,<br><br>levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.  He was<br><br>but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag<br><br>of a black handkerchief investing his neck.  A confluent small-pox<br><br>had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like the<br><br>complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have<br><br>been dried up.<br><br><br><br>"Have ye shipped in her?" he repeated.<br><br><br><br>"You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose," said I, trying to gain a<br><br>little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.<br><br><br><br>"Aye, the Pequod--that ship there," he said, drawing back his whole<br><br>arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the<br><br>fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.<br><br><br><br>"Yes," said I, "we have just signed the articles."<br><br><br><br>"Anything down there about your souls?"<br><br><br><br>"About what?"<br><br><br><br>"Oh, perhaps you hav'n't got any," he said quickly.  "No matter<br><br>though, I know many chaps that hav'n't got any,--good luck to 'em;<br><br>and they are all the better off for it.  A soul's a sort of a fifth<br><br>wheel to a wagon."<br><br><br><br>"What are you jabbering about, shipmate?" said I.<br><br><br><br>"HE'S got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that<br><br>sort in other chaps," abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous<br><br>emphasis upon the word HE.<br><br><br><br>"Queequeg," said I, "let's go; this fellow has broken loose from<br><br>somewhere; he's talking about something and somebody we don't know."<br><br><br><br>"Stop!" cried the stranger.  "Ye said true--ye hav'n't seen Old<br><br>Thunder yet, have ye?"<br><br><br><br>"Who's Old Thunder?" said I, again riveted with the insane<br><br>earnestness of his manner.<br><br><br><br>"Captain Ahab."<br><br><br><br>"What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?"<br><br><br><br>"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name.  Ye<br><br>hav'n't seen him yet, have ye?"<br><br><br><br>"No, we hav'n't.  He's sick they say, but is getting better, and will<br><br>be all right again before long."<br><br><br><br>"All right again before long!" laughed the stranger, with a solemnly<br><br>derisive sort of laugh.  "Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right,<br><br>then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before."<br><br><br><br>"What do you know about him?"<br><br><br><br>"What did they TELL you about him?  Say that!"<br><br><br><br>"They didn't tell much of anything about him; only I've heard that<br><br>he's a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew."<br><br><br><br>"That's true, that's true--yes, both true enough.  But you must jump<br><br>when he gives an order.  Step and growl; growl and go--that's the<br><br>word with Captain Ahab.  But nothing about that thing that happened<br><br>to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days<br><br>and nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard<br><br>afore the altar in Santa?--heard nothing about that, eh?  Nothing<br><br>about the silver calabash he spat into?  And nothing about his losing<br><br>his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy.  Didn't ye hear a<br><br>word about them matters and something more, eh?  No, I don't think ye<br><br>did; how could ye?  Who knows it?  Not all Nantucket, I guess.  But<br><br>hows'ever, mayhap, ye've heard tell about the leg, and how he lost<br><br>it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.  Oh yes, THAT every one<br><br>knows a'most--I mean they know he's only one leg; and that a<br><br>parmacetti took the other off."<br><br><br><br>"My friend," said I, "what all this gibberish of yours is about, I<br><br>don't know, and I don't much care; for it seems to me that you must<br><br>be a little damaged in the head.  But if you are speaking of Captain<br><br>Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I<br><br>know all about the loss of his leg."<br><br><br><br>"ALL about it, eh--sure you do?--all?"<br><br><br><br>"Pretty sure."<br><br><br><br>With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like<br><br>stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a<br><br>little, turned and said:--"Ye've shipped, have ye?  Names down on the<br><br>papers?  Well, well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will<br><br>be; and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all.  Anyhow, it's<br><br>all fixed and arranged a'ready; and some sailors or other must go<br><br>with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity 'em!<br><br>Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye;<br><br>I'm sorry I stopped ye."<br><br><br><br>"Look here, friend," said I, "if you have anything important to tell<br><br>us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are<br><br>mistaken in your game; that's all I have to say."<br><br><br><br>"And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;<br><br>you are just the man for him--the likes of ye.  Morning to ye,<br><br>shipmates, morning!  Oh! when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded<br><br>not to make one of 'em."<br><br><br><br>"Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way--you can't fool us.<br><br>It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a<br><br>great secret in him."<br><br><br><br>"Morning to ye, shipmates, morning."<br><br><br><br>"Morning it is," said I.  "Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this<br><br>crazy man.  But stop, tell me your name, will you?"<br><br><br><br>"Elijah."<br><br><br><br>Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each<br><br>other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was<br><br>nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear.  But we had not gone<br><br>perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and<br><br>looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,<br><br>though at a distance.  Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I<br><br>said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my<br><br>comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same<br><br>corner that we did.  He did; and then it seemed to me that he was<br><br>dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me<br><br>imagine.  This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,<br><br>half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me<br><br>all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all<br><br>connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost;<br><br>and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain<br><br>Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the<br><br>prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves<br><br>to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.<br><br><br><br>I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was<br><br>really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with<br><br>Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.  But Elijah<br><br>passed on, without seeming to notice us.  This relieved me; and once<br><br>more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a<br><br>humbug.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 20<br><br><br><br>All Astir.<br><br><br><br><br><br>A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.<br><br>Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming<br><br>on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short,<br><br>everything betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a<br><br>close.  Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his<br><br>wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the<br><br>purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the<br><br>hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.<br><br><br><br>On the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given<br><br>at all the inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their<br><br>chests must be on board before night, for there was no telling how<br><br>soon the vessel might be sailing.  So Queequeg and I got down our<br><br>traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last.  But it<br><br>seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship<br><br>did not sail for several days.  But no wonder; there was a good deal<br><br>to be done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of,<br><br>before the Pequod was fully equipped.<br><br><br><br>Every one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives<br><br>and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not,<br><br>are indispensable to the business of housekeeping.  Just so with<br><br>whaling, which necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide<br><br>ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and<br><br>bankers.  And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet<br><br>not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen.  For besides<br><br>the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles<br><br>peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of<br><br>replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be<br><br>remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed<br><br>to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss<br><br>of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.<br><br>Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons,<br><br>and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate<br><br>ship.<br><br><br><br>At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of<br><br>the Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread,<br><br>water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves.  But, as before hinted, for<br><br>some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of<br><br>divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.<br><br><br><br>Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain<br><br>Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and<br><br>indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed<br><br>resolved that, if SHE could help it, nothing should be found wanting<br><br>in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea.  At one time she<br><br>would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward's pantry;<br><br>another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate's desk, where<br><br>he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of<br><br>some one's rheumatic back.  Never did any woman better deserve her<br><br>name, which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.  And<br><br>like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle<br><br>about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to<br><br>anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to<br><br>all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was<br><br>concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of<br><br>well-saved dollars.<br><br><br><br>But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming<br><br>on board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand,<br><br>and a still longer whaling lance in the other.  Nor was Bildad himself<br><br>nor Captain Peleg at all backward.  As for Bildad, he carried about<br><br>with him a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh<br><br>arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper.<br><br>Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den,<br><br>roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at<br><br>the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.<br><br><br><br>During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the<br><br>craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and<br><br>when he was going to come on board his ship.  To these questions they<br><br>would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected<br><br>aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could<br><br>attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage.  If<br><br>I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very<br><br>plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this<br><br>way to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who<br><br>was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out<br><br>upon the open sea.  But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes<br><br>happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly<br><br>strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.  And much this<br><br>way it was with me.  I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.<br><br><br><br>At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would<br><br>certainly sail.  So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early<br><br>start.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 21<br><br><br><br>Going Aboard.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when<br><br>we drew nigh the wharf.<br><br><br><br>"There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right," said I<br><br>to Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise, I guess;<br><br>come on!"<br><br><br><br>"Avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close<br><br>behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating<br><br>himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain<br><br>twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me.  It was Elijah.<br><br><br><br>"Going aboard?"<br><br><br><br>"Hands off, will you," said I.<br><br><br><br>"Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"<br><br><br><br>"Ain't going aboard, then?"<br><br><br><br>"Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours?  Do you<br><br>know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?"<br><br><br><br>"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and<br><br>wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable<br><br>glances.<br><br><br><br>"Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.<br><br>We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not<br><br>to be detained."<br><br><br><br>"Ye be, be ye?  Coming back afore breakfast?"<br><br><br><br>"He's cracked, Queequeg," said I, "come on."<br><br><br><br>"Holloa!" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a<br><br>few paces.<br><br><br><br>"Never mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on."<br><br><br><br>But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my<br><br>shoulder, said--"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards<br><br>that ship a while ago?"<br><br><br><br>Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,<br><br>"Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be<br><br>sure."<br><br><br><br>"Very dim, very dim," said Elijah.  "Morning to ye."<br><br><br><br>Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and<br><br>touching my shoulder again, said, "See if you can find 'em now, will<br><br>ye?<br><br><br><br>"Find who?"<br><br><br><br>"Morning to ye! morning to ye!" he rejoined, again moving off.  "Oh!<br><br>I was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it's all<br><br>one, all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it?<br><br>Good-bye to ye.  Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's<br><br>before the Grand Jury."  And with these cracked words he finally<br><br>departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his<br><br>frantic impudence.<br><br><br><br>At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in<br><br>profound quiet, not a soul moving.  The cabin entrance was locked<br><br>within; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.<br><br>Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle<br><br>open.  Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger<br><br>there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.  He was thrown at whole<br><br>length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded<br><br>arms.  The profoundest slumber slept upon him.<br><br><br><br>"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?" said<br><br>I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.  But it seemed that, when on the<br><br>wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I<br><br>would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that<br><br>matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.<br><br>But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly<br><br>hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;<br><br>telling him to establish himself accordingly.  He put his hand upon<br><br>the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and<br><br>then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.<br><br><br><br>"Gracious!  Queequeg, don't sit there," said I.<br><br><br><br>"Oh! perry dood seat," said Queequeg, "my country way; won't hurt<br><br>him face."<br><br><br><br>"Face!" said I, "call that his face? very benevolent countenance<br><br>then; but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off,<br><br>Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor.  Get<br><br>off, Queequeg!  Look, he'll twitch you off soon.  I wonder he don't<br><br>wake."<br><br><br><br>Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and<br><br>lighted his tomahawk pipe.  I sat at the feet.  We kept the pipe<br><br>passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.  Meanwhile, upon<br><br>questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand<br><br>that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all<br><br>sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the<br><br>custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to<br><br>furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up<br><br>eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and<br><br>alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much<br><br>better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into<br><br>walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and<br><br>desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,<br><br>perhaps in some damp marshy place.<br><br><br><br>While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the<br><br>tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the<br><br>sleeper's head.<br><br><br><br>"What's that for, Queequeg?"<br><br><br><br>"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!<br><br><br><br>He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,<br><br>which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and<br><br>soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping<br><br>rigger.  The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole,<br><br>it began to tell upon him.  He breathed with a sort of muffledness;<br><br>then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice;<br><br>then sat up and rubbed his eyes.<br><br><br><br>"Holloa!" he breathed at last, "who be ye smokers?"<br><br><br><br>"Shipped men," answered I, "when does she sail?"<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye?  She sails to-day.  The<br><br>Captain came aboard last night."<br><br><br><br>"What Captain?--Ahab?"<br><br><br><br>"Who but him indeed?"<br><br><br><br>I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when<br><br>we heard a noise on deck.<br><br><br><br>"Holloa!  Starbuck's astir," said the rigger.  "He's a lively chief<br><br>mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn<br><br>to."  And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.<br><br><br><br>It was now clear sunrise.  Soon the crew came on board in twos and<br><br>threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively<br><br>engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing<br><br>various last things on board.  Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained<br><br>invisibly enshrined within his cabin.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 22<br><br><br><br>Merry Christmas.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's<br><br>riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and<br><br>after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with<br><br>her last gift--a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her<br><br>brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward--after all this,<br><br>the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and<br><br>turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:<br><br><br><br>"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?  Captain Ahab<br><br>is all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore,<br><br>eh?  Well, call all hands, then.  Muster 'em aft here--blast 'em!"<br><br><br><br>"No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg," said<br><br>Bildad, "but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding."<br><br><br><br>How now!  Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage,<br><br>Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on<br><br>the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea,<br><br>as well as to all appearances in port.  And, as for Captain Ahab, no<br><br>sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin.<br><br>But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary<br><br>in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.<br><br>Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's;<br><br>and as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore,<br><br>Captain Ahab stayed below.  And all this seemed natural enough;<br><br>especially as in the merchant service many captains never show<br><br>themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the<br><br>anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell<br><br>merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for<br><br>good with the pilot.<br><br><br><br>But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain<br><br>Peleg was now all alive.  He seemed to do most of the talking and<br><br>commanding, and not Bildad.<br><br><br><br>"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors," he cried, as the sailors lingered<br><br>at the main-mast.  "Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft."<br><br><br><br>"Strike the tent there!"--was the next order.  As I hinted before,<br><br>this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board<br><br>the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well<br><br>known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.<br><br><br><br>"Man the capstan!  Blood and thunder!--jump!"--was the next command,<br><br>and the crew sprang for the handspikes.<br><br><br><br>Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the<br><br>pilot is the forward part of the ship.  And here Bildad, who, with<br><br>Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the<br><br>licensed pilots of the port--he being suspected to have got himself<br><br>made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the<br><br>ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other<br><br>craft--Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking<br><br>over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing<br><br>what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the<br><br>windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in<br><br>Booble Alley, with hearty good will.  Nevertheless, not three days<br><br>previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed<br><br>on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and<br><br>Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each<br><br>seaman's berth.<br><br><br><br>Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped<br><br>and swore astern in the most frightful manner.  I almost thought he<br><br>would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily<br><br>I paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking<br><br>of the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a<br><br>devil for a pilot.  I was comforting myself, however, with the<br><br>thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of<br><br>his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp<br><br>poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition<br><br>of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate<br><br>vicinity.  That was my first kick.<br><br><br><br>"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?" he roared.<br><br>"Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone!  Why don't<br><br>ye spring, I say, all of ye--spring!  Quohog! spring, thou chap with<br><br>the red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green<br><br>pants.  Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!"  And so<br><br>saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg<br><br>very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his<br><br>psalmody.  Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something<br><br>to-day.<br><br><br><br>At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.  It<br><br>was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged<br><br>into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean,<br><br>whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.  The long<br><br>rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like<br><br>the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles<br><br>depended from the bows.<br><br><br><br>Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as<br><br>the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering<br><br>frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his<br><br>steady notes were heard,--<br><br><br><br>"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,<br><br>Stand dressed in living green.<br><br>So to the Jews old Canaan stood,<br><br>While Jordan rolled between."<br><br><br><br><br><br>Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.  They<br><br>were full of hope and fruition.  Spite of this frigid winter night in<br><br>the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket,<br><br>there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store;<br><br>and meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by<br><br>the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.<br><br><br><br>At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no<br><br>longer.  The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging<br><br>alongside.<br><br><br><br>It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected<br><br>at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.  For loath to depart,<br><br>yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and<br><br>perilous a voyage--beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some<br><br>thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which<br><br>an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once<br><br>more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath<br><br>to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to<br><br>him,--poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious<br><br>strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word<br><br>there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the<br><br>wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern<br><br>Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and<br><br>left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically<br><br>coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the<br><br>hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically<br><br>in his face, as much as to say, "Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can<br><br>stand it; yes, I can."<br><br><br><br>As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all<br><br>his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the<br><br>lantern came too near.  And he, too, did not a little run from cabin<br><br>to deck--now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief<br><br>mate.<br><br><br><br>But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look<br><br>about him,--"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go.  Back<br><br>the main-yard there!  Boat ahoy!  Stand by to come close alongside,<br><br>now!  Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--say your last.  Luck to<br><br>ye, Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--luck to ye, Mr. Flask--good-bye<br><br>and good luck to ye all--and this day three years I'll have a hot<br><br>supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket.  Hurrah and away!"<br><br><br><br>"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men," murmured old<br><br>Bildad, almost incoherently.  "I hope ye'll have fine weather now, so<br><br>that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all<br><br>he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.<br><br>Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.  Don't stave the boats needlessly,<br><br>ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.<br><br>within the year.  Don't forget your prayers, either.  Mr. Starbuck,<br><br>mind that cooper don't waste the spare staves.  Oh! the sail-needles<br><br>are in the green locker!  Don't whale it too much a' Lord's days,<br><br>men; but don't miss a fair chance either, that's rejecting Heaven's<br><br>good gifts.  Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a<br><br>little leaky, I thought.  If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask,<br><br>beware of fornication.  Good-bye, good-bye!  Don't keep that cheese<br><br>too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it'll spoil.  Be careful<br><br>with the butter--twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if--"<br><br><br><br>"Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,--away!" and with that,<br><br>Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.<br><br><br><br>Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a<br><br>screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave<br><br>three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the<br><br>lone Atlantic.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 23<br><br><br><br>The Lee Shore.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded<br><br>mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.<br><br><br><br>When on that shivering winter's night, the Pequod thrust her<br><br>vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see<br><br>standing at her helm but Bulkington!  I looked with sympathetic awe<br><br>and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a<br><br>four years' dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for<br><br>still another tempestuous term.  The land seemed scorching to his<br><br>feet.  Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories<br><br>yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of<br><br>Bulkington.  Let me only say that it fared with him as with the<br><br>storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land.  The<br><br>port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is<br><br>safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all<br><br>that's kind to our mortalities.  But in that gale, the port, the<br><br>land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality;<br><br>one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her<br><br>shudder through and through.  With all her might she crowds all sail<br><br>off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would<br><br>blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again; for<br><br>refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her<br><br>bitterest foe!<br><br><br><br>Know ye now, Bulkington?  Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally<br><br>intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the<br><br>intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea;<br><br>while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on<br><br>the treacherous, slavish shore?<br><br><br><br>But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,<br><br>indefinite as God--so, better is it to perish in that howling<br><br>infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were<br><br>safety!  For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land!<br><br>Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain?  Take heart, take<br><br>heart, O Bulkington!  Bear thee grimly, demigod!  Up from the spray<br><br>of thy ocean-perishing--straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 24<br><br><br><br>The Advocate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of<br><br>whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be<br><br>regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable<br><br>pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of<br><br>the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.<br><br><br><br>In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish<br><br>the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not<br><br>accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions.<br><br>If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan<br><br>society, it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his<br><br>merits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if<br><br>in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials<br><br>S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure<br><br>would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.<br><br><br><br>Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us<br><br>whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to<br><br>a butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged<br><br>therein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements.  Butchers we<br><br>are, that is true.  But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest<br><br>badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably<br><br>delights to honour.  And as for the matter of the alleged<br><br>uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into<br><br>certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the<br><br>whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among<br><br>the cleanliest things of this tidy earth.  But even granting the<br><br>charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a<br><br>whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those<br><br>battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all<br><br>ladies' plaudits?  And if the idea of peril so much enhances the<br><br>popular conceit of the soldier's profession; let me assure ye that<br><br>many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly<br><br>recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into<br><br>eddies the air over his head.  For what are the comprehensible<br><br>terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of<br><br>God!<br><br><br><br>But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it<br><br>unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding<br><br>adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn<br><br>round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!<br><br><br><br>But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of<br><br>scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.<br><br><br><br>Why did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admirals of their whaling<br><br>fleets?  Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense,<br><br>fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town<br><br>some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket?  Why<br><br>did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in<br><br>bounties upwards of L1,000,000?  And lastly, how comes it that we<br><br>whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen<br><br>in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned<br><br>by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the<br><br>ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year<br><br>importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000.  How<br><br>comes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?<br><br><br><br>But this is not the half; look again.<br><br><br><br>I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his<br><br>life, point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last<br><br>sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world,<br><br>taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling.<br><br>One way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in<br><br>themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues,<br><br>that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore<br><br>offspring themselves pregnant from her womb.  It would be a hopeless,<br><br>endless task to catalogue all these things.  Let a handful suffice.<br><br>For many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting<br><br>out the remotest and least known parts of the earth.  She has<br><br>explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook or<br><br>Vancouver had ever sailed.  If American and European men-of-war<br><br>now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to<br><br>the honour and glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them<br><br>the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.  They<br><br>may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your<br><br>Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous<br><br>Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and<br><br>greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.  For in their<br><br>succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters,<br><br>and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with<br><br>virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and<br><br>muskets would not willingly have dared.  All that is made such a<br><br>flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the<br><br>life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers.  Often,<br><br>adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men<br><br>accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship's common log.  Ah,<br><br>the world!  Oh, the world!<br><br><br><br>Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,<br><br>scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe<br><br>and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific<br><br>coast.  It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous<br><br>policy of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space<br><br>permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at<br><br>last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the<br><br>yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in<br><br>those parts.<br><br><br><br>That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was<br><br>given to the enlightened world by the whaleman.  After its first<br><br>blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned<br><br>those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched<br><br>there.  The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.<br><br>Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the<br><br>emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent<br><br>biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.<br><br>The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do<br><br>commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the<br><br>missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive<br><br>missionaries to their first destinations.  If that double-bolted<br><br>land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone<br><br>to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.<br><br><br><br>But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has<br><br>no aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I<br><br>ready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a<br><br>split helmet every time.<br><br><br><br>The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you<br><br>will say.<br><br><br><br>THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER?  Who<br><br>wrote the first account of our Leviathan?  Who but mighty Job!  And<br><br>who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage?  Who, but no<br><br>less a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen,<br><br>took down the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those<br><br>times!  And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament?  Who,<br><br>but Edmund Burke!<br><br><br><br>True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have<br><br>no good blood in their veins.<br><br><br><br>NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS?  They have something better than royal<br><br>blood there.  The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;<br><br>afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of<br><br>Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and<br><br>harpooneers--all kith and kin to noble Benjamin--this day darting the<br><br>barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.<br><br><br><br>Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not<br><br>respectable.<br><br><br><br>WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE?

There is a saltcellar of state, so<br><br>called, and there may be a castor of state.  How they use the salt,<br><br>precisely--who knows?  Certain I am, however, that a king's head is<br><br>solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad.  Can it<br><br>be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior<br><br>run well, as they anoint machinery?  Much might be ruminated here,<br><br>concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in<br><br>common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who<br><br>anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing.  In truth, a<br><br>mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has<br><br>probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.  As a general rule, he<br><br>can't amount to much in his totality.<br><br><br><br>But the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil<br><br>is used at coronations?  Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor<br><br>macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor<br><br>cod-liver oil.  What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in<br><br>its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?<br><br><br><br>Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and<br><br>queens with coronation stuff!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 26<br><br><br><br>Knights and Squires.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and<br><br>a Quaker by descent.  He was a long, earnest man, and though born on<br><br>an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh<br><br>being hard as twice-baked biscuit.  Transported to the Indies, his<br><br>live blood would not spoil like bottled ale.  He must have been born<br><br>in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast<br><br>days for which his state is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers<br><br>had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical<br><br>superfluousness.  But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more<br><br>the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the<br><br>indication of any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of<br><br>the man.  He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.  His<br><br>pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it,<br><br>and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified<br><br>Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to<br><br>come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid<br><br>sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted<br><br>to do well in all climates.  Looking into his eyes, you seemed to<br><br>see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he<br><br>had calmly confronted through life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose<br><br>life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a<br><br>tame chapter of sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and<br><br>fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times<br><br>affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the<br><br>rest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep<br><br>natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did<br><br>therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of<br><br>superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,<br><br>somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and<br><br>inward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the<br><br>welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories<br><br>of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from<br><br>the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to<br><br>those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain<br><br>the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more<br><br>perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  "I will have no man in my<br><br>boat," said Starbuck, "who is not afraid of a whale."  By this, he<br><br>seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage<br><br>was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered<br><br>peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous<br><br>comrade than a coward.<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye," said Stubb, the second mate, "Starbuck, there, is as<br><br>careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery."  But we shall<br><br>ere long see what that word "careful" precisely means when used by a<br><br>man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.<br><br><br><br>Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a<br><br>sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon<br><br>all mortally practical occasions.  Besides, he thought, perhaps, that<br><br>in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple<br><br>outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be<br><br>foolishly wasted.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales<br><br>after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much<br><br>persisted in fighting him.  For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this<br><br>critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by<br><br>them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck<br><br>well knew.  What doom was his own father's?  Where, in the bottomless<br><br>deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?<br><br><br><br>With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain<br><br>superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck<br><br>which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been<br><br>extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so<br><br>organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he<br><br>had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently<br><br>engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,<br><br>would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.<br><br>And brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly,<br><br>visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in<br><br>the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary<br><br>irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more<br><br>terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you<br><br>from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.<br><br><br><br>But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete<br><br>abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart<br><br>to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to<br><br>expose the fall of valour in the soul.  Men may seem detestable as<br><br>joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there<br><br>may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal,<br><br>is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that<br><br>over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to<br><br>throw their costliest robes.  That immaculate manliness we feel<br><br>within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all<br><br>the outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the<br><br>undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man.  Nor can piety itself, at<br><br>such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the<br><br>permitting stars.  But this august dignity I treat of, is not the<br><br>dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no<br><br>robed investiture.  Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields<br><br>a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all<br><br>hands, radiates without end from God; Himself!

He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,<br><br>according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man.  A<br><br>happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they<br><br>came with an indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent<br><br>crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman<br><br>joiner engaged for the year.  Good-humored, easy, and careless, he<br><br>presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but<br><br>a dinner, and his crew all invited guests.  He was as particular<br><br>about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an<br><br>old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box.  When close to the<br><br>whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying<br><br>lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.  He<br><br>would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the<br><br>most exasperated monster.  Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted<br><br>the jaws of death into an easy chair.  What he thought of death<br><br>itself, there is no telling.  Whether he ever thought of it at all,<br><br>might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that<br><br>way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took<br><br>it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir<br><br>themselves there, about something which he would find out when he<br><br>obeyed the order, and not sooner.<br><br><br><br>What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,<br><br>unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a<br><br>world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their<br><br>packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of<br><br>his; that thing must have been his pipe.  For, like his nose, his<br><br>short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.<br><br>You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk<br><br>without his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whole row of pipes<br><br>there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand;<br><br>and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession,<br><br>lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading<br><br>them again to be in readiness anew.  For, when Stubb dressed, instead<br><br>of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his<br><br>mouth.<br><br><br><br>I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of<br><br>his peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,<br><br>whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless<br><br>miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as<br><br>in time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated<br><br>handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal<br><br>tribulations, Stubb's tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of<br><br>disinfecting agent.<br><br><br><br>The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard.<br><br>A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning<br><br>whales, who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had<br><br>personally and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a<br><br>sort of point of honour with him, to destroy them whenever<br><br>encountered.  So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for<br><br>the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead<br><br>to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from<br><br>encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was<br><br>but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring<br><br>only a little circumvention and some small application of time and<br><br>trouble in order to kill and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious<br><br>fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of<br><br>whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years'<br><br>voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length<br><br>of time.  As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and<br><br>cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.  Little Flask was one<br><br>of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.  They called<br><br>him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could be<br><br>well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic<br><br>whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers<br><br>inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy<br><br>concussions of those battering seas.<br><br><br><br>Now these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous<br><br>men.  They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the<br><br>Pequod's boats as headsmen.  In that grand order of battle in which<br><br>Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the<br><br>whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies.  Or,<br><br>being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a<br><br>picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of<br><br>javelins.<br><br><br><br>And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a<br><br>Gothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or<br><br>harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh<br><br>lance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the<br><br>assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a<br><br>close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in<br><br>this place we set down who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to what<br><br>headsman each of them belonged.<br><br><br><br>First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had<br><br>selected for his squire.  But Queequeg is already known.<br><br><br><br>Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly<br><br>promontory of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the last<br><br>remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the<br><br>neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring<br><br>harpooneers.  In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of<br><br>Gay-Headers.  Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek<br><br>bones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their<br><br>largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this<br><br>sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of<br><br>those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England<br><br>moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.<br><br>But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the<br><br>woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the<br><br>sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible<br><br>arrow of the sires.  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky<br><br>limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of<br><br>the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son<br><br>of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.  Tashtego was Stubb the<br><br>second mate's squire.<br><br><br><br>Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black<br><br>negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.<br><br>Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the<br><br>sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the<br><br>top-sail halyards to them.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily<br><br>shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native<br><br>coast.  And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa,<br><br>Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and<br><br>having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the<br><br>ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they<br><br>shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a<br><br>giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in<br><br>his socks.  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and<br><br>a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce<br><br>of a fortress.  Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus<br><br>Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man<br><br>beside him.  As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said,<br><br>that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men<br><br>before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans<br><br>born, though pretty nearly all the officers are.  Herein it is the<br><br>same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and<br><br>military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in<br><br>the construction of the American Canals and Railroads.  The same, I<br><br>say, because in all these cases the native American liberally<br><br>provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying<br><br>the muscles.  No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the<br><br>Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to<br><br>augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.<br><br>In like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London,<br><br>put in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of<br><br>their crew.  Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again.<br><br>How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best<br><br>whalemen.  They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, ISOLATOES<br><br>too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but<br><br>each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own.  Yet now,<br><br>federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!  An<br><br>Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all<br><br>the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the<br><br>world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them<br><br>ever come back.  Black Little Pip--he never did--oh, no! he went<br><br>before.  Poor Alabama boy!  On the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye shall<br><br>ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal<br><br>time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid<br><br>strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a<br><br>coward here, hailed a hero there!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 28<br><br><br><br>Ahab.<br><br><br><br><br><br>For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was<br><br>seen of Captain Ahab.  The mates regularly relieved each other at the<br><br>watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they<br><br>seemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes<br><br>issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that<br><br>after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.  Yes, their<br><br>supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any<br><br>eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the<br><br>cabin.<br><br><br><br>Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly<br><br>gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first<br><br>vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion<br><br>of the sea, became almost a perturbation.  This was strangely<br><br>heightened at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences<br><br>uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have<br><br>before conceived of.  But poorly could I withstand them, much as in<br><br>other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities<br><br>of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.  But whatever it was of<br><br>apprehensiveness or uneasiness--to call it so--which I felt, yet<br><br>whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all<br><br>warrantry to cherish such emotions.  For though the harpooneers, with<br><br>the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and<br><br>motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my<br><br>previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed<br><br>this--and rightly ascribed it--to the fierce uniqueness of the very<br><br>nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so<br><br>abandonedly embarked.  But it was especially the aspect of the three<br><br>chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly<br><br>calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence<br><br>and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.  Three better,<br><br>more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,<br><br>could not readily be found, and they were every one of them<br><br>Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man.  Now, it being<br><br>Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had<br><br>biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the<br><br>southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we<br><br>sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its<br><br>intolerable weather behind us.  It was one of those less lowering,<br><br>but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when<br><br>with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a<br><br>vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted<br><br>to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled<br><br>my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.<br><br>Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his<br><br>quarter-deck.<br><br><br><br>There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the<br><br>recovery from any.  He looked like a man cut away from the stake,<br><br>when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without<br><br>consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged<br><br>robustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,<br><br>and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus.<br><br>Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right<br><br>down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it<br><br>disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly<br><br>whitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the<br><br>straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning<br><br>tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels<br><br>and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the<br><br>soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.  Whether<br><br>that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some<br><br>desperate wound, no one could certainly say.  By some tacit consent,<br><br>throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it,<br><br>especially by the mates.  But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head<br><br>Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was<br><br>full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it<br><br>came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an<br><br>elemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially<br><br>negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,<br><br>who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this<br><br>laid eye upon wild Ahab.  Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the<br><br>immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with<br><br>preternatural powers of discernment.  So that no white sailor<br><br>seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab<br><br>should be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he<br><br>muttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,<br><br>would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.<br><br><br><br>So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the<br><br>livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I<br><br>hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing<br><br>to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had<br><br>previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned<br><br>from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.  "Aye, he was<br><br>dismasted off Japan," said the old Gay-Head Indian once; "but like<br><br>his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for<br><br>it.  He has a quiver of 'em."<br><br><br><br>I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side<br><br>of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,<br><br>there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the<br><br>plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and<br><br>holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out<br><br>beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of<br><br>firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the<br><br>fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he<br><br>spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their<br><br>minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if<br><br>not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And<br><br>not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a<br><br>crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing<br><br>dignity of some mighty woe.<br><br><br><br>Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his<br><br>cabin.  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;<br><br>either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he<br><br>had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;<br><br>indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less<br><br>a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the<br><br>dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,<br><br>by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the<br><br>air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at<br><br>last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But<br><br>the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;<br><br>nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were<br><br>fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of<br><br>himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that<br><br>one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his<br><br>brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves<br><br>upon.<br><br><br><br>Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the<br><br>pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him<br><br>from his mood.  For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April<br><br>and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the<br><br>barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send<br><br>forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants;<br><br>so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of<br><br>that girlish air.  More than once did he put forth the faint blossom<br><br>of a look, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a<br><br>smile.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 29<br><br><br><br>Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now<br><br>went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost<br><br>perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the<br><br>Tropic.  The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,<br><br>redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped<br><br>up--flaked up, with rose-water snow.  The starred and stately nights<br><br>seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely<br><br>pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden<br><br>helmeted suns!  For sleeping man, 'twas hard to choose between such<br><br>winsome days and such seducing nights.  But all the witcheries of<br><br>that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to<br><br>the outward world.  Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when<br><br>the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals<br><br>as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.  And all these<br><br>subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab's texture.<br><br><br><br>Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the<br><br>less man has to do with aught that looks like death.  Among<br><br>sea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths<br><br>to visit the night-cloaked deck.  It was so with Ahab; only that now,<br><br>of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly<br><br>speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to<br><br>the planks.  "It feels like going down into one's tomb,"--he would<br><br>mutter to himself--"for an old captain like me to be descending this<br><br>narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth."<br><br><br><br>So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night<br><br>were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band<br><br>below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the<br><br>sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some<br><br>cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their<br><br>slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin<br><br>to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the<br><br>cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at the<br><br>iron banister, to help his crippled way.  Some considering touch of<br><br>humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained<br><br>from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,<br><br>seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have<br><br>been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their<br><br>dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks.  But once,<br><br>the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with<br><br>heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to<br><br>mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a<br><br>certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain<br><br>Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but<br><br>there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something<br><br>indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion<br><br>into it, of the ivory heel.  Ah!  Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab<br><br>then.<br><br><br><br>"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb," said Ahab, "that thou wouldst wad me<br><br>that fashion?  But go thy ways; I had forgot.  Below to thy nightly<br><br>grave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the<br><br>filling one at last.--Down, dog, and kennel!"<br><br><br><br>Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly<br><br>scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,<br><br>"I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half<br><br>like it, sir."<br><br><br><br>"Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving<br><br>away, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.<br><br><br><br>"No, sir; not yet," said Stubb, emboldened, "I will not tamely be<br><br>called a dog, sir."<br><br><br><br>"Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and<br><br>begone, or I'll clear the world of thee!"<br><br><br><br>As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors<br><br>in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.<br><br><br><br>"I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,"<br><br>muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.<br><br>"It's very queer.  Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know<br><br>whether to go back and strike him, or--what's that?--down here on my<br><br>knees and pray for him?  Yes, that was the thought coming up in me;<br><br>but it would be the first time I ever DID pray.  It's queer; very<br><br>queer; and he's queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the<br><br>queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with.  How he flashed at me!--his<br><br>eyes like powder-pans! is he mad?  Anyway there's something on his<br><br>mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.<br><br>He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the<br><br>twenty-four; and he don't sleep then.  Didn't that Dough-Boy, the<br><br>steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's<br><br>hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the<br><br>foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort<br><br>of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it?  A hot old<br><br>man!  I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it's<br><br>a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say--worse nor a toothache.  Well, well;<br><br>I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it.  He's<br><br>full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every<br><br>night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should<br><br>like to know?  Who's made appointments with him in the hold?  Ain't<br><br>that queer, now?  But there's no telling, it's the old game--Here<br><br>goes for a snooze.  Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be born<br><br>into the world, if only to fall right asleep.  And now that I think<br><br>of it, that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of<br><br>queer, too.  Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em.<br><br>But that's against my principles.  Think not, is my eleventh<br><br>commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes<br><br>again.  But how's that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me<br><br>ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT!  He<br><br>might as well have kicked me, and done with it.  Maybe he DID kick<br><br>me, and I didn't observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow,<br><br>somehow.  It flashed like a bleached bone.  What the devil's the<br><br>matter with me?  I don't stand right on my legs.  Coming afoul of<br><br>that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.  By the Lord, I<br><br>must have been dreaming, though--How? how? how?--but the only way's<br><br>to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the morning, I'll<br><br>see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 30<br><br><br><br>The Pipe.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the<br><br>bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a<br><br>sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also<br><br>his pipe.  Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the<br><br>stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.<br><br><br><br>In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were<br><br>fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.  How could<br><br>one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without<br><br>bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized?  For a Khan of the<br><br>plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was<br><br>Ahab.<br><br><br><br>Some moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth<br><br>in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face.<br><br>"How now," he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, "this<br><br>smoking no longer soothes.  Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if<br><br>thy charm be gone!  Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not<br><br>pleasuring--aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to<br><br>windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale,<br><br>my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.  What<br><br>business have I with this pipe?  This thing that is meant for<br><br>sereneness, to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs, not<br><br>among torn iron-grey locks like mine.  I'll smoke no more--"<br><br><br><br>He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea.  The fire hissed in<br><br>the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking<br><br>pipe made.  With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 31<br><br><br><br>Queen Mab.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.<br><br><br><br>"Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had.  You know the old man's<br><br>ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to<br><br>kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off!<br><br>And then, presto!  Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool,<br><br>kept kicking at it.  But what was still more curious, Flask--you know<br><br>how curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I<br><br>somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not<br><br>much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.  'Why,' thinks I, 'what's the<br><br>row?  It's not a real leg, only a false leg.'  And there's a mighty<br><br>difference between a living thump and a dead thump.  That's what<br><br>makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear<br><br>than a blow from a cane.  The living member--that makes the living<br><br>insult, my little man.  And thinks I to myself all the while, mind,<br><br>while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid--so<br><br>confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was<br><br>thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but a cane--a whalebone<br><br>cane.  Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only a playful cudgelling--in fact,<br><br>only a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base kick.  Besides,'<br><br>thinks I, 'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot part--what a<br><br>small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,<br><br>THERE'S a devilish broad insult.  But this insult is whittled down to<br><br>a point only.'  But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.<br><br>While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired<br><br>old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and<br><br>slews me round.  'What are you 'bout?' says he.  Slid! man, but I was<br><br>frightened.  Such a phiz!  But, somehow, next moment I was over the<br><br>fright.  'What am I about?' says I at last.  'And what business is<br><br>that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback?  Do YOU want a<br><br>kick?'  By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned<br><br>round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he<br><br>had for a clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man,<br><br>his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out.  Says<br><br>I, on second thoughts, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.'  'Wise<br><br>Stubb,' said he, 'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a<br><br>sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.  Seeing he wasn't<br><br>going to stop saying over his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I<br><br>might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.  But I had only just<br><br>lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!'<br><br>'Halloa,' says I, 'what's the matter now, old fellow?'  'Look ye<br><br>here,' says he; 'let's argue the insult.  Captain Ahab kicked ye,<br><br>didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,' says I--'right HERE it was.'  'Very<br><br>good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg, didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,'<br><br>says I.  'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb, what have you to complain<br><br>of?  Didn't he kick with right good will? it wasn't a common pitch<br><br>pine leg he kicked with, was it?  No, you were kicked by a great man,<br><br>and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.  It's an honour; I consider it<br><br>an honour.  Listen, wise Stubb.  In old England the greatest lords<br><br>think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made<br><br>garter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by<br><br>old Ahab, and made a wise man of.  Remember what I say; BE kicked by<br><br>him; account his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you<br><br>can't help yourself, wise Stubb.  Don't you see that pyramid?'  With<br><br>that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to<br><br>swim off into the air.  I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my<br><br>hammock!  Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?"<br><br><br><br>"I don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'"<br><br><br><br>"May be; may be.  But it's made a wise man of me, Flask.  D'ye see<br><br>Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern?  Well, the best<br><br>thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to<br><br>him, whatever he says.  Halloa!  What's that he shouts?  Hark!"<br><br><br><br>"Mast-head, there!  Look sharp, all of ye!  There are whales<br><br>hereabouts!<br><br><br><br>If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!<br><br><br><br>"What do you think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small drop of<br><br>something queer about that, eh?  A white whale--did ye mark that,<br><br>man?  Look ye--there's something special in the wind.  Stand by for<br><br>it, Flask.  Ahab has that that's bloody on his mind.  But, mum; he<br><br>comes this way."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 32<br><br><br><br>Cetology.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be<br><br>lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities.  Ere that come to pass;<br><br>ere the Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled<br><br>hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a<br><br>matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding<br><br>of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all<br><br>sorts which are to follow.<br><br><br><br>It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,<br><br>that I would now fain put before you.  Yet is it no easy task.  The<br><br>classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here<br><br>essayed.  Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid<br><br>down.<br><br><br><br>"No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled<br><br>Cetology," says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.<br><br><br><br>"It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the<br><br>inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and<br><br>families....  Utter confusion exists among the historians of this<br><br>animal" (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.<br><br><br><br>"Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters."<br><br>"Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea."  "A field<br><br>strewn with thorns."  "All these incomplete indications but serve to<br><br>torture us naturalists."<br><br><br><br>Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and<br><br>Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy.  Nevertheless, though of<br><br>real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and<br><br>so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales.<br><br>Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen,<br><br>who have at large or in little, written of the whale.  Run over a<br><br>few:--The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir<br><br>Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green;<br><br>Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest;<br><br>Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale;<br><br>Bennett; J.  Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and<br><br>the Rev.  T.  Cheever.  But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all<br><br>these have written, the above cited extracts will show.<br><br><br><br>Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen<br><br>ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional<br><br>harpooneer and whaleman.  I mean Captain Scoresby.  On the separate<br><br>subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing<br><br>authority.  But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great<br><br>sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost<br><br>unworthy mentioning.  And here be it said, that the Greenland whale<br><br>is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.  He is not even by any<br><br>means the largest of the whales.  Yet, owing to the long priority of<br><br>his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years<br><br>back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and<br><br>which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few<br><br>scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every<br><br>way complete.  Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in<br><br>the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland<br><br>whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.  But<br><br>the time has at last come for a new proclamation.  This is Charing<br><br>Cross; hear ye! good people all,--the Greenland whale is<br><br>deposed,--the great sperm whale now reigneth!<br><br><br><br>There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the<br><br>living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest<br><br>degree succeed in the attempt.  Those books are Beale's and<br><br>Bennett's; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea<br><br>whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men.  The original matter<br><br>touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily<br><br>small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though<br><br>mostly confined to scientific description.  As yet, however, the<br><br>sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any<br><br>literature.  Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten<br><br>life.<br><br><br><br>Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular<br><br>comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the<br><br>present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent<br><br>laborers.  As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I<br><br>hereupon offer my own poor endeavors.  I promise nothing complete;<br><br>because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very<br><br>reason infallibly be faulty.  I shall not pretend to a minute<br><br>anatomical description of the various species, or--in this place at<br><br>least--to much of any description.  My object here is simply to<br><br>project the draught of a systematization of cetology.  I am the<br><br>architect, not the builder.<br><br><br><br>But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the<br><br>Post-Office is equal to it.  To grope down into the bottom of the sea<br><br>after them; to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations,<br><br>ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing.  What am<br><br>I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan!  The awful<br><br>tauntings in Job might well appal me.  "Will he the (leviathan) make<br><br>a covenant with thee?  Behold the hope of him is vain!  But I have<br><br>swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do<br><br>with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will<br><br>try.  There are some preliminaries to settle.<br><br><br><br>First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology<br><br>is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters<br><br>it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his<br><br>System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, "I hereby separate<br><br>the whales from the fish."  But of my own knowledge, I know that down<br><br>to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against<br><br>Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of<br><br>the same seas with the Leviathan.<br><br><br><br>The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales<br><br>from the waters, he states as follows: "On account of their warm<br><br>bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow<br><br>ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem," and finally, "ex<br><br>lege naturae jure meritoque."  I submitted all this to my friends<br><br>Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine<br><br>in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons<br><br>set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted<br><br>they were humbug.<br><br><br><br>Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned<br><br>ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.<br><br>This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal<br><br>respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has<br><br>given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm<br><br>blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.<br><br><br><br>Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as<br><br>conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,<br><br>a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have<br><br>him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded<br><br>meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not<br><br>a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the<br><br>definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost<br><br>any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have<br><br>not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among<br><br>spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably<br><br>assumes a horizontal position.<br><br><br><br>By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude<br><br>from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified<br><br>with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other<br><br>hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as<br><br>alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish<br><br>must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come<br><br>the grand divisions of the entire whale host.<br><br><br><br><br><br>*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins<br><br>and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are<br><br>included by many naturalists among the whales.  But as these pig-fish<br><br>are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of<br><br>rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout,<br><br>I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with<br><br>their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.<br><br><br><br><br><br>First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary<br><br>BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them<br><br>all, both small and large.<br><br><br><br>I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.<br><br><br><br>As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO,<br><br>the GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE.<br><br><br><br>FOLIOS.  Among these I here include the following chapters:--I. The<br><br>SPERM WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; III. the FIN-BACK WHALE; IV. the<br><br>HUMP-BACKED WHALE; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI. the SULPHUR-BOTTOM<br><br>WHALE.<br><br><br><br>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the<br><br>English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter<br><br>whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the<br><br>French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of<br><br>the Long Words.  He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the<br><br>globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most<br><br>majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce;<br><br>he being the only creature from which that valuable substance,<br><br>spermaceti, is obtained.  All his peculiarities will, in many other<br><br>places, be enlarged upon.  It is chiefly with his name that I now<br><br>have to do.  Philologically considered, it is absurd.  Some centuries<br><br>ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own<br><br>proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained<br><br>from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was<br><br>popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the<br><br>one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale.  It was<br><br>the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of<br><br>the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally<br><br>expresses.  In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce,<br><br>not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.  It<br><br>was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of<br><br>rhubarb.  When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of<br><br>spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the<br><br>dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely<br><br>significant of its scarcity.  And so the appellation must at last<br><br>have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti<br><br>was really derived.<br><br><br><br>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect this is<br><br>the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly<br><br>hunted by man.  It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or<br><br>baleen; and the oil specially known as "whale oil," an inferior<br><br>article in commerce.  Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately<br><br>designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland<br><br>Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right<br><br>Whale.  There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the<br><br>species thus multitudinously baptised.  What then is the whale, which<br><br>I include in the second species of my Folios?  It is the Great<br><br>Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the<br><br>English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the<br><br>Growlands Walfish of the Swedes.  It is the whale which for more than<br><br>two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the<br><br>Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long<br><br>pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West<br><br>Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right<br><br>Whale Cruising Grounds.<br><br><br><br>Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the<br><br>English and the right whale of the Americans.  But they precisely<br><br>agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a<br><br>single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction.<br><br>It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive<br><br>differences, that some departments of natural history become so<br><br>repellingly intricate.  The right whale will be elsewhere treated of<br><br>at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.<br><br><br><br>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Under this head I reckon a<br><br>monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and<br><br>Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the<br><br>whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing<br><br>the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.  In the length he<br><br>attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale,<br><br>but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to<br><br>olive.  His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the<br><br>intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.  His grand<br><br>distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is<br><br>often a conspicuous object.  This fin is some three or four feet<br><br>long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an<br><br>angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.  Even if not the<br><br>slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin<br><br>will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.  When<br><br>the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical<br><br>ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon<br><br>the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle<br><br>surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy<br><br>hour-lines graved on it.  On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes<br><br>back.  The Fin-Back is not gregarious.  He seems a whale-hater, as<br><br>some men are man-haters.  Very shy; always going solitary;<br><br>unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen<br><br>waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall<br><br>misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous<br><br>power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from<br><br>man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his<br><br>race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.  From having the<br><br>baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the<br><br>right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,<br><br>that is, whales with baleen.  Of these so called Whalebone whales,<br><br>there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are<br><br>little known.  Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed<br><br>whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are<br><br>the fishermen's names for a few sorts.<br><br><br><br>In connection with this appellative of "Whalebone whales," it is of<br><br>great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be<br><br>convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it<br><br>is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,<br><br>founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;<br><br>notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously<br><br>seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of<br><br>Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the<br><br>whale, in his kinds, presents.  How then?  The baleen, hump,<br><br>back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are<br><br>indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any<br><br>regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and<br><br>more essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked<br><br>whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.  Then, this<br><br>same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has<br><br>baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.  And it is just the<br><br>same with the other parts above mentioned.  In various sorts of<br><br>whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any<br><br>one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy<br><br>all general methodization formed upon such a basis.  On this rock<br><br>every one of the whale-naturalists has split.<br><br><br><br>But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the<br><br>whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the<br><br>right classification.  Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the<br><br>Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?  Yet we have<br><br>seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the<br><br>Greenland whale.  And if you descend into the bowels of the various<br><br>leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part<br><br>as available to the systematizer as those external ones already<br><br>enumerated.  What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the<br><br>whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them<br><br>that way.  And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and<br><br>it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is<br><br>practicable.  To proceed.<br><br><br><br>BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This whale is often seen on<br><br>the northern American coast.  He has been frequently captured there,<br><br>and towed into harbor.  He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or<br><br>you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale.  At any rate, the<br><br>popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the<br><br>sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one.  His oil is not<br><br>very valuable.  He has baleen.  He is the most gamesome and<br><br>light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water<br><br>generally than any other of them.<br><br><br><br>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).--Of this whale little is<br><br>known but his name.  I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn.  Of<br><br>a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers.  Though<br><br>no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which<br><br>rises in a long sharp ridge.  Let him go.  I know little more of him,<br><br>nor does anybody else.<br><br><br><br>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Another retiring<br><br>gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along<br><br>the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings.  He is seldom<br><br>seen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern<br><br>seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his<br><br>countenance.  He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks<br><br>of line.  Prodigies are told of him.  Adieu, Sulphur Bottom!  I can<br><br>say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.<br><br><br><br>Thus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).<br><br><br><br>OCTAVOES.*--These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among<br><br>which present may be numbered:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH;<br><br>III., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER.<br><br><br><br><br><br>*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.<br><br>Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those<br><br>of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to<br><br>them in figure, yet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its dimensioned<br><br>form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo<br><br>volume does.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).--Though this fish, whose<br><br>loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb<br><br>to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not<br><br>popularly classed among whales.  But possessing all the grand<br><br>distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have<br><br>recognised him for one.  He is of moderate octavo size, varying from<br><br>fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding<br><br>dimensions round the waist.  He swims in herds; he is never regularly<br><br>hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good<br><br>for light.  By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory<br><br>of the advance of the great sperm whale.<br><br><br><br>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I give the popular<br><br>fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the<br><br>best.  Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall<br><br>say so, and suggest another.  I do so now, touching the Black Fish,<br><br>so-called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales.<br><br>So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please.  His voracity is well<br><br>known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips<br><br>are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on<br><br>his face.  This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in<br><br>length.  He is found in almost all latitudes.  He has a peculiar way<br><br>of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something<br><br>like a Roman nose.  When not more profitably employed, the sperm<br><br>whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the<br><br>supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as some frugal<br><br>housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by<br><br>themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.  Though<br><br>their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you<br><br>upwards of thirty gallons of oil.<br><br><br><br>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL<br><br>WHALE.--Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I<br><br>suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked<br><br>nose.  The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn<br><br>averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to<br><br>fifteen feet.  Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk,<br><br>growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the<br><br>horizontal.  But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an<br><br>ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a<br><br>clumsy left-handed man.  What precise purpose this ivory horn or<br><br>lance answers, it would be hard to say.  It does not seem to be used<br><br>like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors<br><br>tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the<br><br>bottom of the sea for food.  Charley Coffin said it was used for an<br><br>ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar<br><br>Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so<br><br>breaks through.  But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be<br><br>correct.  My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may<br><br>really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would<br><br>certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading<br><br>pamphlets.  The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the<br><br>Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale.  He is certainly a curious<br><br>example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of<br><br>animated nature.  From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered<br><br>that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the<br><br>great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it<br><br>brought immense prices.  It was also distilled to a volatile salts<br><br>for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are<br><br>manufactured into hartshorn.  Originally it was in itself accounted<br><br>an object of great curiosity.  Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin<br><br>Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did<br><br>gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich<br><br>Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; "when Sir Martin<br><br>returned from that voyage," saith Black Letter, "on bended knees he<br><br>presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale,<br><br>which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor."  An<br><br>Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did<br><br>likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land<br><br>beast of the unicorn nature.<br><br><br><br>The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a<br><br>milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.<br><br>His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,<br><br>and he is seldom hunted.  He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.<br><br><br><br>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).--Of this whale little is<br><br>precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the<br><br>professed naturalist.  From what I have seen of him at a distance,<br><br>I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus.  He is very<br><br>savage--a sort of Feegee fish.  He sometimes takes the great Folio<br><br>whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty<br><br>brute is worried to death.  The Killer is never hunted.  I never<br><br>heard what sort of oil he has.  Exception might be taken to the name<br><br>bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness.  For<br><br>we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks<br><br>included.<br><br><br><br>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).--This gentleman is famous<br><br>for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.  He<br><br>mounts the Folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage<br><br>by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a<br><br>similar process.  Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the<br><br>Killer.  Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.<br><br><br><br>Thus ends BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).<br><br><br><br>DUODECIMOES.--These include the smaller whales.  I. The Huzza<br><br>Porpoise.  II. The Algerine Porpoise.  III. The Mealy-mouthed<br><br>Porpoise.<br><br><br><br>To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may<br><br>possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or<br><br>five feet should be marshalled among WHALES--a word, which, in the<br><br>popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.  But the creatures<br><br>set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of<br><br>my definition of what a whale is--i.e. a spouting fish, with a<br><br>horizontal tail.<br><br><br><br>BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the<br><br>common porpoise found almost all over the globe.  The name is of my<br><br>own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and<br><br>something must be done to distinguish them.  I call him thus, because<br><br>he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep<br><br>tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd.<br><br>Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner.<br><br>Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to<br><br>windward.  They are the lads that always live before the wind.  They<br><br>are accounted a lucky omen.  If you yourself can withstand three<br><br>cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the<br><br>spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.  A well-fed, plump Huzza<br><br>Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil.  But the fine<br><br>and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable.<br><br>It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers.  Sailors put it on<br><br>their hones.  Porpoise meat is good eating, you know.  It may never<br><br>have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts.  Indeed, his spout is so<br><br>small that it is not very readily discernible.  But the next time you<br><br>have a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great Sperm whale<br><br>himself in miniature.<br><br><br><br>BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pirate.<br><br>Very savage.  He is only found, I think, in the Pacific.  He is<br><br>somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general<br><br>make.  Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark.  I have lowered<br><br>for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.<br><br><br><br>BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The<br><br>largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it<br><br>is known.  The only English name, by which he has hitherto been<br><br>designated, is that of the fishers--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the<br><br>circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio.<br><br>In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of<br><br>a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and<br><br>gentleman-like figure.  He has no fins on his back (most other<br><br>porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of<br><br>a hazel hue.  But his mealy-mouth spoils all.  Though his entire<br><br>back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line,<br><br>distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called the "bright waist,"<br><br>that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours,<br><br>black above and white below.  The white comprises part of his head,<br><br>and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just<br><br>escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag.  A most mean and mealy<br><br>aspect!  His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the<br><br>Porpoise is the smallest of the whales.  Above, you have all the<br><br>Leviathans of note.  But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,<br><br>half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by<br><br>reputation, but not personally.  I shall enumerate them by their<br><br>fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to<br><br>future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun.<br><br>If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked,<br><br>then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to<br><br>his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--The Bottle-Nose Whale;<br><br>the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading<br><br>Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the<br><br>Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc.<br><br>From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might<br><br>be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of<br><br>uncouth names.  But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can<br><br>hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism,<br><br>but signifying nothing.<br><br><br><br>Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be<br><br>here, and at once, perfected.  You cannot but plainly see that I have<br><br>kept my word.  But I now leave my cetological System standing thus<br><br>unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the<br><br>crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.  For<br><br>small erections may be finished by their first architects; grand<br><br>ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity.  God keep me<br><br>from ever completing anything.  This whole book is but a<br><br>draught--nay, but the draught of a draught.  Oh, Time, Strength,<br><br>Cash, and Patience!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 33<br><br><br><br>The Specksynder.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a<br><br>place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,<br><br>arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a<br><br>class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.<br><br><br><br>The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced<br><br>by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries<br><br>and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in<br><br>the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an<br><br>officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means<br><br>Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief<br><br>Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to<br><br>the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the<br><br>whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or<br><br>Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,<br><br>under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is<br><br>still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present<br><br>he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the<br><br>captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good<br><br>conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely<br><br>depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an<br><br>important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night<br><br>watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also<br><br>his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he<br><br>should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in<br><br>some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,<br><br>by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.<br><br><br><br>Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is<br><br>this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships<br><br>and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the<br><br>captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers<br><br>are lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take<br><br>their meals in the captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly<br><br>communicating with it.<br><br><br><br>Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the<br><br>longest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils<br><br>of it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all<br><br>of whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages,<br><br>but upon their common luck, together with their common vigilance,<br><br>intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some cases<br><br>tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen<br><br>generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family<br><br>these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for<br><br>all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck<br><br>are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.  Indeed,<br><br>many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper<br><br>parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in<br><br>any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if<br><br>he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.<br><br><br><br>And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least<br><br>given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only<br><br>homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though<br><br>he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping<br><br>upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to<br><br>peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be<br><br>detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of<br><br>condescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was<br><br>by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.<br><br><br><br>Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind<br><br>those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;<br><br>incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than<br><br>they were legitimately intended to subserve.  That certain sultanism<br><br>of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained<br><br>unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became<br><br>incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.  For be a man's<br><br>intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the<br><br>practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of<br><br>some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves,<br><br>more or less paltry and base.  This it is, that for ever keeps God's<br><br>true princes of the Empire from the world's hustings; and leaves the<br><br>highest honours that this air can give, to those men who become famous<br><br>more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful<br><br>of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over<br><br>the dead level of the mass.  Such large virtue lurks in these small<br><br>things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some<br><br>royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.<br><br>But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of<br><br>geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian<br><br>herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.  Nor, will<br><br>the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its<br><br>fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so<br><br>important in his art, as the one now alluded to.<br><br><br><br>But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket<br><br>grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and<br><br>Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old<br><br>whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical<br><br>trappings and housings are denied me.  Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand<br><br>in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in<br><br>the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 34<br><br><br><br>The Cabin-Table.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale<br><br>loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his<br><br>lord and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been<br><br>taking an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the<br><br>latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that<br><br>daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.  From his complete<br><br>inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not<br><br>heard his menial.  But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,<br><br>he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,<br><br>saying, "Dinner, Mr. Starbuck," disappears into the cabin.<br><br><br><br>When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck,<br><br>the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then<br><br>Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the<br><br>planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some<br><br>touch of pleasantness, "Dinner, Mr. Stubb," and descends the scuttle.<br><br>The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly<br><br>shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with<br><br>that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a<br><br>rapid "Dinner, Mr. Flask," follows after his predecessors.<br><br><br><br>But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,<br><br>seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all<br><br>sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off<br><br>his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe<br><br>right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,<br><br>pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down<br><br>rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,<br><br>reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.<br><br>But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new<br><br>face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask<br><br>enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the<br><br>Slave.<br><br><br><br>It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense<br><br>artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck<br><br>some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and<br><br>defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those<br><br>very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in<br><br>that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not<br><br>to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head<br><br>of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.  Wherefore<br><br>this difference?  A problem?  Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar,<br><br>King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but<br><br>courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane<br><br>grandeur.  But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit<br><br>presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that<br><br>man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the<br><br>time; that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's, for<br><br>Belshazzar was not the greatest.  Who has but once dined his friends,<br><br>has tasted what it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social<br><br>czarship which there is no withstanding.  Now, if to this<br><br>consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master,<br><br>then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of<br><br>sea-life just mentioned.<br><br><br><br>Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned<br><br>sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but<br><br>still deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited<br><br>to be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in<br><br>Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.  With<br><br>one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as<br><br>he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the<br><br>world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest<br><br>observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And<br><br>when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef<br><br>was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the<br><br>mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;<br><br>and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the<br><br>plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without<br><br>circumspection.  For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where<br><br>the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial<br><br>Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in<br><br>awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;<br><br>only he himself was dumb.  What a relief it was to choking Stubb,<br><br>when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little<br><br>Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family<br><br>party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have<br><br>been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,<br><br>this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first<br><br>degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more<br><br>would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;<br><br>nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask<br><br>helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed<br><br>it.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.<br><br>Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on<br><br>account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he<br><br>deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter<br><br>was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however<br><br>it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!<br><br><br><br>Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and<br><br>Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's dinner was<br><br>badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start<br><br>of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.<br><br>If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have<br><br>but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his<br><br>repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than<br><br>three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to<br><br>precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted<br><br>in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an<br><br>officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be<br><br>otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much<br><br>relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and<br><br>satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.<br><br>I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned<br><br>beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast.<br><br>There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:<br><br>there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any mere<br><br>sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official<br><br>capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample<br><br>vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask<br><br>through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before<br><br>awful Ahab.<br><br><br><br>Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first<br><br>table in the Pequod's cabin.  After their departure, taking place in<br><br>inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or<br><br>rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.  And<br><br>then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its<br><br>residuary legatees.  They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of<br><br>the high and mighty cabin.<br><br><br><br>In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless<br><br>invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire<br><br>care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those<br><br>inferior fellows the harpooneers.  While their masters, the mates,<br><br>seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the<br><br>harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a<br><br>report to it.  They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like<br><br>Indian ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites<br><br>had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the<br><br>previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a<br><br>great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.<br><br>And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble<br><br>hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of<br><br>accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And<br><br>once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory<br><br>by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty<br><br>wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the<br><br>circle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,<br><br>shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the<br><br>progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the<br><br>standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical<br><br>tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life<br><br>was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers<br><br>furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their<br><br>clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at<br><br>them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.<br><br><br><br>It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing<br><br>his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on<br><br>the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to<br><br>the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the<br><br>low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes<br><br>passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was<br><br>wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible<br><br>that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the<br><br>vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.<br><br>But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the<br><br>abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in<br><br>the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants<br><br>made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of<br><br>the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the<br><br>trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth<br><br>lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing<br><br>out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the<br><br>simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round<br><br>him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the<br><br>whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their<br><br>lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they<br><br>would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not<br><br>at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that<br><br>in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been<br><br>guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!<br><br>hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin<br><br>should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to<br><br>his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;<br><br>to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones<br><br>jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.<br><br><br><br>But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived<br><br>there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were<br><br>scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before<br><br>sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar<br><br>quarters.<br><br><br><br>In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale<br><br>captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights<br><br>the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone<br><br>that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there.  So that, in real<br><br>truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be<br><br>said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did<br><br>enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning<br><br>inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a<br><br>permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much<br><br>hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was<br><br>inaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of<br><br>Christendom, he was still an alien to it.  He lived in the world, as<br><br>the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri.  And as when<br><br>Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying<br><br>himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking<br><br>his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul,<br><br>shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen<br><br>paws of its gloom!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 35<br><br><br><br>The Mast-Head.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with<br><br>the other seamen my first mast-head came round.<br><br><br><br>In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost<br><br>simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she<br><br>may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her<br><br>proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'<br><br>voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an<br><br>empty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;<br><br>and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port,<br><br>does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.<br><br><br><br>Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a<br><br>very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate<br><br>here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the<br><br>old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to<br><br>them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must<br><br>doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest<br><br>mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was<br><br>put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have<br><br>gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we<br><br>cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And<br><br>that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an<br><br>assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that<br><br>the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory<br><br>singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four<br><br>sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of<br><br>their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and<br><br>sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing<br><br>out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,<br><br>the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone<br><br>pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life<br><br>on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in<br><br>him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless<br><br>stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by<br><br>fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything<br><br>out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern<br><br>standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,<br><br>and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,<br><br>are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon<br><br>discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top<br><br>of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred<br><br>and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;<br><br>whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great<br><br>Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in<br><br>Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that<br><br>point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral<br><br>Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in<br><br>Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,<br><br>token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is<br><br>smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor<br><br>Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked<br><br>to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they<br><br>gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate<br><br>through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what<br><br>rocks must be shunned.<br><br><br><br>It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head<br><br>standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is<br><br>not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole<br><br>historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells<br><br>us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were<br><br>regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island<br><br>erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs<br><br>ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in<br><br>a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay<br><br>whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to<br><br>the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now<br><br>become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a<br><br>whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from<br><br>sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the<br><br>helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene<br><br>weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,<br><br>to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a<br><br>hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if<br><br>the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your<br><br>legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships<br><br>once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.<br><br>There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing<br><br>ruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy<br><br>trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.  For the most<br><br>part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests<br><br>you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling<br><br>accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary<br><br>excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt<br><br>securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of<br><br>what you shall have for dinner--for all your meals for three years<br><br>and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is<br><br>immutable.<br><br><br><br>In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'<br><br>voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at<br><br>the mast-head would amount to several entire months.  And it is much<br><br>to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a<br><br>portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly<br><br>destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or<br><br>adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains<br><br>to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or<br><br>any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men<br><br>temporarily isolate themselves.  Your most usual point of perch is<br><br>the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin<br><br>parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant<br><br>cross-trees.  Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about<br><br>as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.  To be sure, in cold<br><br>weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a<br><br>watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more<br><br>of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of<br><br>its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even<br><br>move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an<br><br>ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat<br><br>is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional<br><br>skin encasing you.  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in<br><br>your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your<br><br>watch-coat.<br><br><br><br>Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of<br><br>a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents<br><br>or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a<br><br>Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the<br><br>frozen seas.  In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled<br><br>"A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and<br><br>incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of<br><br>Old Greenland;" in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads<br><br>are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then<br><br>recently invented CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of<br><br>Captain Sleet's good craft.  He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in<br><br>honour of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and<br><br>free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call<br><br>our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original<br><br>inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after<br><br>ourselves any other apparatus we may beget.  In shape, the Sleet's<br><br>crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open<br><br>above, however, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to<br><br>keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.  Being fixed on the<br><br>summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in<br><br>the bottom.  On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship,<br><br>is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas,<br><br>comforters, and coats.  In front is a leather rack, in which to keep<br><br>your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical<br><br>conveniences.  When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in<br><br>this crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with<br><br>him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot,<br><br>for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea<br><br>unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at<br><br>them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot<br><br>down upon them is a very different thing.  Now, it was plainly a<br><br>labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the<br><br>little detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so<br><br>enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very<br><br>scientific account of his experiments in this crow's-nest, with a<br><br>small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the<br><br>errors resulting from what is called the "local attraction" of all<br><br>binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of<br><br>the iron in the ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to<br><br>there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I<br><br>say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here,<br><br>yet, for all his learned "binnacle deviations," "azimuth compass<br><br>observations," and "approximate errors," he knows very well, Captain<br><br>Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic<br><br>meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that<br><br>well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side<br><br>of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand.  Though, upon the<br><br>whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and<br><br>learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so<br><br>utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and<br><br>comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded<br><br>head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest<br><br>within three or four perches of the pole.<br><br><br><br>But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as<br><br>Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is<br><br>greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those<br><br>seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float.  For one, I<br><br>used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to<br><br>have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find<br><br>there; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg<br><br>over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery<br><br>pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.<br><br><br><br>Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept<br><br>but sorry guard.  With the problem of the universe revolving in me,<br><br>how could I--being left completely to myself at such a<br><br>thought-engendering altitude--how could I but lightly hold my<br><br>obligations to observe all whale-ships' standing orders, "Keep your<br><br>weather eye open, and sing out every time."<br><br><br><br>And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of<br><br>Nantucket!  Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad<br><br>with lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness;<br><br>and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his<br><br>head.  Beware of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before<br><br>they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you<br><br>ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the<br><br>richer.  Nor are these monitions at all unneeded.  For nowadays, the<br><br>whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and<br><br>absent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth,<br><br>and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber.  Childe Harold not<br><br>unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless<br><br>disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates:--<br><br><br><br>"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!  Ten thousand<br><br>blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain."<br><br><br><br>Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded<br><br>young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling<br><br>sufficient "interest" in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so<br><br>hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret<br><br>souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise.  But all in<br><br>vain; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is<br><br>imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the<br><br>visual nerve?  They have left their opera-glasses at home.<br><br><br><br>"Why, thou monkey," said a harpooneer to one of these lads, "we've<br><br>been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a<br><br>whale yet.  Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up<br><br>here."  Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of<br><br>them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like<br><br>listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded<br><br>youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he<br><br>loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the<br><br>visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind<br><br>and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing<br><br>that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some<br><br>undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive<br><br>thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through<br><br>it.  In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came;<br><br>becomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer's sprinkled<br><br>Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round<br><br>globe over.<br><br><br><br>There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a<br><br>gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from<br><br>the inscrutable tides of God.  But while this sleep, this dream is on<br><br>ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your<br><br>identity comes back in horror.  Over Descartian vortices you hover.<br><br>And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one<br><br>half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the<br><br>summer sea, no more to rise for ever.  Heed it well, ye Pantheists!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 36<br><br><br><br>The Quarter-Deck.<br><br><br><br><br><br>(ENTER AHAB: THEN, ALL)<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one<br><br>morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the<br><br>cabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-captains usually walk at<br><br>that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few<br><br>turns in the garden.<br><br><br><br>Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his<br><br>old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all<br><br>over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his<br><br>walk.  Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;<br><br>there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints<br><br>of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.<br><br><br><br>But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as<br><br>his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.  And, so full of<br><br>his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at<br><br>the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that<br><br>thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so<br><br>completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward<br><br>mould of every outer movement.<br><br><br><br>"D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the chick that's in him<br><br>pecks the shell.  'Twill soon be out."<br><br><br><br>The hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing<br><br>the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.<br><br><br><br>It drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by the<br><br>bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and<br><br>with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send<br><br>everybody aft.<br><br><br><br>"Sir!" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on<br><br>ship-board except in some extraordinary case.<br><br><br><br>"Send everybody aft," repeated Ahab.  "Mast-heads, there! come down!"<br><br><br><br>When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and<br><br>not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not<br><br>unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after<br><br>rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among<br><br>the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were<br><br>nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and<br><br>half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering<br><br>whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,<br><br>that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing<br><br>a pedestrian feat.  But this did not last long.  Vehemently pausing,<br><br>he cried:--<br><br><br><br>"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"<br><br><br><br>"Sing out for him!" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of<br><br>clubbed voices.<br><br><br><br>"Good!" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the<br><br>hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so<br><br>magnetically thrown them.<br><br><br><br>"And what do ye next, men?"<br><br><br><br>"Lower away, and after him!"<br><br><br><br>"And what tune is it ye pull to, men?"<br><br><br><br>"A dead whale or a stove boat!"<br><br><br><br>More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the<br><br>countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began<br><br>to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that<br><br>they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless<br><br>questions.<br><br><br><br>But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in<br><br>his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,<br><br>almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--<br><br><br><br>"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a<br><br>white whale.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?"--holding<br><br>up a broad bright coin to the sun--"it is a sixteen dollar piece,<br><br>men.  D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul."<br><br><br><br>While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was<br><br>slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if<br><br>to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile<br><br>lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and<br><br>inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of<br><br>his vitality in him.<br><br><br><br>Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the<br><br>main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold<br><br>with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: "Whosoever<br><br>of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a<br><br>crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with<br><br>three holes punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of<br><br>ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my<br><br>boys!"<br><br><br><br>"Huzza! huzza!" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they<br><br>hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.<br><br><br><br>"It's a white whale, I say," resumed Ahab, as he threw down the<br><br>topmaul: "a white whale.  Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for<br><br>white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out."<br><br><br><br>All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even<br><br>more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention<br><br>of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was<br><br>separately touched by some specific recollection.<br><br><br><br>"Captain Ahab," said Tashtego, "that white whale must be the same<br><br>that some call Moby Dick."<br><br><br><br>"Moby Dick?" shouted Ahab.  "Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?"<br><br><br><br>"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?" said<br><br>the Gay-Header deliberately.<br><br><br><br>"And has he a curious spout, too," said Daggoo, "very bushy, even for<br><br>a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?"<br><br><br><br>"And he have one, two, three--oh! good many iron in him hide, too,<br><br>Captain," cried Queequeg disjointedly, "all twiske-tee be-twisk, like<br><br>him--him--" faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round<br><br>and round as though uncorking a bottle--"like him--him--"<br><br><br><br>"Corkscrew!" cried Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted<br><br>and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a<br><br>whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after<br><br>the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like<br><br>a split jib in a squall.  Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye<br><br>have seen--Moby Dick--Moby Dick!"<br><br><br><br>"Captain Ahab," said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus<br><br>far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last<br><br>seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.<br><br>"Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick<br><br>that took off thy leg?"<br><br><br><br>"Who told thee that?" cried Ahab; then pausing, "Aye, Starbuck; aye,<br><br>my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick<br><br>that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.  Aye, aye," he<br><br>shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a<br><br>heart-stricken moose; "Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale<br><br>that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!"<br><br>Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted<br><br>out: "Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the<br><br>Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames<br><br>before I give him up.  And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to<br><br>chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of<br><br>earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.  What say ye,<br><br>men, will ye splice hands on it, now?  I think ye do look brave."<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye!" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the<br><br>excited old man: "A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for<br><br>Moby Dick!"<br><br><br><br>"God bless ye," he seemed to half sob and half shout.  "God bless ye,<br><br>men.  Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.  But what's this<br><br>long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale?<br><br>art not game for Moby Dick?"<br><br><br><br>"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,<br><br>Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we<br><br>follow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance.<br><br>How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest<br><br>it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket<br><br>market."<br><br><br><br>"Nantucket market!  Hoot!  But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest<br><br>a little lower layer.  If money's to be the measurer, man, and the<br><br>accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by<br><br>girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,<br><br>let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE!"<br><br><br><br>"He smites his chest," whispered Stubb, "what's that for? methinks it<br><br>rings most vast, but hollow."<br><br><br><br>"Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "that simply smote thee<br><br>from blindest instinct!  Madness!  To be enraged with a dumb thing,<br><br>Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous."<br><br><br><br>"Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer.  All visible objects,<br><br>man, are but as pasteboard masks.  But in each event--in the living<br><br>act, the undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning<br><br>thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the<br><br>unreasoning mask.  If man will strike, strike through the mask!  How<br><br>can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?<br><br>To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.  Sometimes I<br><br>think there's naught beyond.  But 'tis enough.  He tasks me; he heaps<br><br>me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice<br><br>sinewing it.  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be<br><br>the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak<br><br>that hate upon him.  Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the<br><br>sun if it insulted me.  For could the sun do that, then could I do<br><br>the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy<br><br>presiding over all creations.  But not my master, man, is even that<br><br>fair play.  Who's over me?  Truth hath no confines.  Take off thine<br><br>eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare!  So,<br><br>so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow.<br><br>But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays<br><br>itself.  There are men from whom warm words are small indignity.  I<br><br>meant not to incense thee.  Let it go.  Look! see yonder Turkish<br><br>cheeks of spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the<br><br>sun.  The Pagan leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things,<br><br>that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they<br><br>feel!  The crew, man, the crew!  Are they not one and all with Ahab,<br><br>in this matter of the whale?  See Stubb! he laughs!  See yonder<br><br>Chilian! he snorts to think of it.  Stand up amid the general<br><br>hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck!  And what is it?<br><br>Reckon it.  'Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for<br><br>Starbuck.  What is it more?  From this one poor hunt, then, the best<br><br>lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every<br><br>foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone?  Ah! constrainings seize<br><br>thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!  Speak, but speak!--Aye, aye! thy<br><br>silence, then, THAT voices thee.  (ASIDE) Something shot from my<br><br>dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs.  Starbuck now is<br><br>mine; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion."<br><br><br><br>"God keep me!--keep us all!" murmured Starbuck, lowly.<br><br><br><br>But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab<br><br>did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from<br><br>the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the<br><br>cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as<br><br>for a moment their hearts sank in.  For again Starbuck's downcast<br><br>eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh<br><br>died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved<br><br>and rolled as before.  Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye<br><br>not when ye come?  But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye<br><br>shadows!  Yet not so much predictions from without, as verifications<br><br>of the foregoing things within.  For with little external to<br><br>constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still<br><br>drive us on.<br><br><br><br>"The measure! the measure!" cried Ahab.<br><br><br><br>Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he<br><br>ordered them to produce their weapons.  Then ranging them before him<br><br>near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three<br><br>mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's<br><br>company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant<br><br>searchingly eyeing every man of his crew.  But those wild eyes met<br><br>his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of<br><br>their leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the<br><br>bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.<br><br><br><br>"Drink and pass!" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the<br><br>nearest seaman.  "The crew alone now drink.  Round with it, round!<br><br>Short draughts--long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof.  So,<br><br>so; it goes round excellently.  It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the<br><br>serpent-snapping eye.  Well done; almost drained.  That way it went,<br><br>this way it comes.  Hand it me--here's a hollow!  Men, ye seem the<br><br>years; so brimming life is gulped and gone.  Steward, refill!<br><br><br><br>"Attend now, my braves.  I have mustered ye all round this capstan;<br><br>and ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand<br><br>there with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may<br><br>in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before<br><br>me.  O men, you will yet see that--Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies<br><br>come not sooner.  Hand it me.  Why, now, this pewter had run brimming<br><br>again, were't not thou St. Vitus' imp--away, thou ague!<br><br><br><br>"Advance, ye mates!  Cross your lances full before me.  Well done!<br><br>Let me touch the axis."  So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the<br><br>three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so<br><br>doing, suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing<br><br>intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask.  It seemed as<br><br>though, by some nameless, interior volition, he would fain have<br><br>shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the<br><br>Leyden jar of his own magnetic life.  The three mates quailed before<br><br>his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect.  Stubb and Flask looked<br><br>sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.<br><br><br><br>"In vain!" cried Ahab; "but, maybe, 'tis well.  For did ye three but<br><br>once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, THAT<br><br>had perhaps expired from out me.  Perchance, too, it would have<br><br>dropped ye dead.  Perchance ye need it not.  Down lances!  And now,<br><br>ye mates, I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen<br><br>there--yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant<br><br>harpooneers.  Disdain the task?  What, when the great Pope washes the<br><br>feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer?  Oh, my sweet cardinals!<br><br>your own condescension, THAT shall bend ye to it.  I do not order ye;<br><br>ye will it.  Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!"<br><br><br><br>Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the<br><br>detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held,<br><br>barbs up, before him.<br><br><br><br>"Stab me not with that keen steel!  Cant them; cant them over! know<br><br>ye not the goblet end?  Turn up the socket!  So, so; now, ye<br><br>cup-bearers, advance.  The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!"<br><br>Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed<br><br>the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.<br><br><br><br>"Now, three to three, ye stand.  Commend the murderous chalices!<br><br>Bestow them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league.<br><br>Ha!  Starbuck! but the deed is done!  Yon ratifying sun now waits to<br><br>sit upon it.  Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man<br><br>the deathful whaleboat's bow--Death to Moby Dick!  God hunt us all,<br><br>if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!"  The long, barbed steel<br><br>goblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white<br><br>whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.<br><br>Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered.  Once more, and finally,<br><br>the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when,<br><br>waving his free hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired<br><br>within his cabin.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 37<br><br><br><br>Sunset.<br><br><br><br><br><br>THE CABIN; BY THE STERN WINDOWS; AHAB SITTING ALONE, AND GAZING OUT.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er<br><br>I sail.

Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not<br><br>its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly<br><br>confounds.  'Tis iron--that I know--not gold.  'Tis split, too--that<br><br>I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against<br><br>the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no<br><br>helmet in the most brain-battering fight!<br><br><br><br>Dry heat upon my brow?

A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's<br><br>quenchless feud seemed mine.  With greedy ears I learned the history<br><br>of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken<br><br>our oaths of violence and revenge.<br><br><br><br>For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,<br><br>secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly<br><br>frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen.  But not all of them knew of<br><br>his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen<br><br>him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given<br><br>battle to him, was small indeed.  For, owing to the large number of<br><br>whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the<br><br>entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their<br><br>quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole<br><br>twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling<br><br>sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the<br><br>irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other<br><br>circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread<br><br>through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special<br><br>individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick.  It was hardly to be<br><br>doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such<br><br>or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of<br><br>uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great<br><br>mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some<br><br>minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in<br><br>question must have been no other than Moby Dick.  Yet as of late the<br><br>Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent<br><br>instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster<br><br>attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly<br><br>gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part,<br><br>were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it<br><br>were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the<br><br>individual cause.  In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter<br><br>between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.<br><br><br><br>And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by<br><br>chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had<br><br>every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,<br><br>as for any other whale of that species.  But at length, such<br><br>calamities did ensue in these assaults--not restricted to sprained<br><br>wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal<br><br>to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses,<br><br>all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those<br><br>things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to<br><br>whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.<br><br><br><br>Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the<br><br>more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters.  For not<br><br>only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all<br><br>surprising terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth to its<br><br>fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma,<br><br>wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them<br><br>to cling to.  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so<br><br>the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the<br><br>wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate<br><br>there.  For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that<br><br>ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all<br><br>sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact<br><br>with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face<br><br>they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle<br><br>to them.  Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a<br><br>thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to<br><br>any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of<br><br>the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a<br><br>calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending<br><br>to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.<br><br><br><br>No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit<br><br>over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale<br><br>did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid<br><br>hints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies,<br><br>which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from<br><br>anything that visibly appears.  So that in many cases such a panic<br><br>did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had<br><br>heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to<br><br>encounter the perils of his jaw.<br><br><br><br>But there were still other and more vital practical influences at<br><br>work.  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the<br><br>Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the<br><br>leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.  There<br><br>are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous<br><br>enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would<br><br>perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or<br><br>timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there<br><br>are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not<br><br>sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered<br><br>the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is<br><br>restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;<br><br>seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish<br><br>fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern<br><br>whaling.  Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm<br><br>Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those<br><br>prows which stem him.<br><br><br><br>And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary<br><br>times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book<br><br>naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only<br><br>to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to<br><br>be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human<br><br>blood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or<br><br>almost similar impressions effaced.  For in his Natural History, the<br><br>Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish<br><br>(sharks included) are "struck with the most lively terrors," and<br><br>"often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against<br><br>the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death."  And<br><br>however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports<br><br>as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty<br><br>item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some<br><br>vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.<br><br><br><br>So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few<br><br>of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier<br><br>days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to<br><br>induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this<br><br>new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other<br><br>leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance<br><br>at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.<br><br>That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick<br><br>eternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may<br><br>be consulted.<br><br><br><br>Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things<br><br>were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number<br><br>who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the<br><br>specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious<br><br>accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle<br><br>if offered.<br><br><br><br>One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be<br><br>linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously<br><br>inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;<br><br>that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one<br><br>and the same instant of time.<br><br><br><br>Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit<br><br>altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.  For<br><br>as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been<br><br>divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of<br><br>the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,<br><br>unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated<br><br>the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,<br><br>especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a<br><br>great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the<br><br>most widely distant points.<br><br><br><br>It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,<br><br>and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by<br><br>Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the<br><br>Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted<br><br>in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of<br><br>these instances it has been declared that the interval of time<br><br>between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.<br><br>Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the<br><br>Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to<br><br>the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living<br><br>men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello<br><br>mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in<br><br>which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still<br><br>more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose<br><br>waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an<br><br>underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully<br><br>equalled by the realities of the whalemen.<br><br><br><br>Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and<br><br>knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had<br><br>escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some<br><br>whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring<br><br>Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but<br><br>ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in<br><br>his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should<br><br>ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a<br><br>ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of<br><br>leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.<br><br><br><br>But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough<br><br>in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to<br><br>strike the imagination with unwonted power.  For, it was not so much<br><br>his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm<br><br>whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white<br><br>wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were<br><br>his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,<br><br>uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to<br><br>those who knew him.<br><br><br><br>The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with<br><br>the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his<br><br>distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally<br><br>justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through<br><br>a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all<br><br>spangled with golden gleamings.<br><br><br><br>Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet<br><br>his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural<br><br>terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to<br><br>specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his<br><br>assaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of<br><br>dismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his<br><br>exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had<br><br>several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down<br><br>upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back<br><br>in consternation to their ship.<br><br><br><br>Already several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though<br><br>similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means<br><br>unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White<br><br>Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or<br><br>death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been<br><br>inflicted by an unintelligent agent.<br><br><br><br>Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds<br><br>of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of<br><br>chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out<br><br>of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,<br><br>exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.<br><br><br><br>His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in<br><br>the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,<br><br>had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly<br><br>seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the<br><br>whale.  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenly<br><br>sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had<br><br>reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.  No<br><br>turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with<br><br>more seeming malice.  Small reason was there to doubt, then, that<br><br>ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild<br><br>vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his<br><br>frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all<br><br>his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual<br><br>exasperations.  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac<br><br>incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel<br><br>eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and<br><br>half a lung.  That intangible malignity which has been from the<br><br>beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe<br><br>one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east<br><br>reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship<br><br>it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred<br><br>white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.  All that<br><br>most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all<br><br>truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the<br><br>brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to<br><br>crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable<br><br>in Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all<br><br>the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and<br><br>then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's<br><br>shell upon it.<br><br><br><br>It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise<br><br>at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.  Then, in darting at<br><br>the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,<br><br>passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that<br><br>tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but<br><br>nothing more.  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards<br><br>home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay<br><br>stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that<br><br>dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and<br><br>gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.<br><br>That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,<br><br>that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the<br><br>fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;<br><br>and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in<br><br>his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium,<br><br>that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he<br><br>sailed, raving in his hammock.  In a strait-jacket, he swung to the<br><br>mad rockings of the gales.  And, when running into more sufferable<br><br>latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the<br><br>tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium<br><br>seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth<br><br>from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he<br><br>bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm<br><br>orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was<br><br>now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.  Human<br><br>madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.  When you<br><br>think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still<br><br>subtler form.  Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly<br><br>contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows<br><br>narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.  But, as in<br><br>his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had<br><br>been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great<br><br>natural intellect had perished.  That before living agent, now became<br><br>the living instrument.  If such a furious trope may stand, his<br><br>special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned<br><br>all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from<br><br>having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a<br><br>thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear<br><br>upon any one reasonable object.<br><br><br><br>This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains<br><br>unhinted.  But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is<br><br>profound.  Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked<br><br>Hotel de Cluny where we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now<br><br>quit it;--and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast<br><br>Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of<br><br>man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits<br><br>in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned<br><br>on torsoes!  So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that<br><br>captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his<br><br>frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages.  Wind ye down there, ye<br><br>prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king!  A family<br><br>likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from<br><br>your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.<br><br><br><br>Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my<br><br>means are sane, my motive and my object mad.  Yet without power to<br><br>kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind<br><br>he did long dissemble; in some sort, did still.  But that thing of<br><br>his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his<br><br>will determinate.  Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that<br><br>dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no<br><br>Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and<br><br>that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken<br><br>him.<br><br><br><br>The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly<br><br>ascribed to a kindred cause.  And so too, all the added moodiness<br><br>which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on<br><br>the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow.  Nor is it so very<br><br>unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling<br><br>voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of<br><br>that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those<br><br>very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a<br><br>pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales.<br><br>Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting<br><br>fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would<br><br>seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the<br><br>most appalling of all brutes.  Or, if for any reason thought to be<br><br>corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem<br><br>superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the<br><br>attack.  But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad<br><br>secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had<br><br>purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and<br><br>all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.  Had any one of his<br><br>old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in<br><br>him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have<br><br>wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man!  They were bent on<br><br>profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the<br><br>mint.  He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural<br><br>revenge.<br><br><br><br>Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with<br><br>curses a Job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too,<br><br>chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and<br><br>cannibals--morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere<br><br>unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invunerable<br><br>jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading<br><br>mediocrity in Flask.  Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially<br><br>picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his<br><br>monomaniac revenge.  How it was that they so aboundingly responded to<br><br>the old man's ire--by what evil magic their souls were possessed,<br><br>that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much<br><br>their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be--what the<br><br>White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings,<br><br>also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding<br><br>great demon of the seas of life,--all this to explain, would be to<br><br>dive deeper than Ishmael can go.  The subterranean miner that works<br><br>in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever<br><br>shifting, muffled sound of his pick?  Who does not feel the<br><br>irresistible arm drag?  What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand<br><br>still?  For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and<br><br>the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see<br><br>naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 42<br><br><br><br>The Whiteness of The Whale.<br><br><br><br><br><br>What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he<br><br>was to me, as yet remains unsaid.<br><br><br><br>Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick,<br><br>which could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm,<br><br>there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror<br><br>concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely<br><br>overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable<br><br>was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form.<br><br>It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me.<br><br>But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim,<br><br>random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be<br><br>naught.<br><br><br><br>Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,<br><br>as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,<br><br>japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way<br><br>recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the<br><br>barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title "Lord of the<br><br>White Elephants" above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of<br><br>dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white<br><br>quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the<br><br>one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire,<br><br>Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour<br><br>the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to<br><br>the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over<br><br>every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been<br><br>even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone<br><br>marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and<br><br>symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching,<br><br>noble things--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though<br><br>among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum<br><br>was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes, whiteness<br><br>typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and<br><br>contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by<br><br>milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most<br><br>august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine<br><br>spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white<br><br>forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek<br><br>mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white<br><br>bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of<br><br>the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their<br><br>theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest<br><br>envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of<br><br>their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for<br><br>white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their<br><br>sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and<br><br>though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially<br><br>employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the<br><br>Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the<br><br>four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white<br><br>throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for<br><br>all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and<br><br>honourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the<br><br>innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul<br><br>than that redness which affrights in blood.<br><br><br><br>This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,<br><br>when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any<br><br>object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest<br><br>bounds.  Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of<br><br>the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the<br><br>transcendent horrors they are?  That ghastly whiteness it is which<br><br>imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than<br><br>terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect.  So that not the<br><br>fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as<br><br>the white-shrouded bear or shark.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him<br><br>who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the<br><br>whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable<br><br>hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened<br><br>hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that<br><br>the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in<br><br>the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing<br><br>together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear<br><br>frightens us with so unnatural a contrast.  But even assuming all<br><br>this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not<br><br>have that intensified terror.<br><br><br><br>As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in<br><br>that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies<br><br>with the same quality in the Polar quadruped.  This peculiarity is<br><br>most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that<br><br>fish.  The Romish mass for the dead begins with "Requiem eternam"<br><br>(eternal rest), whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself, and any<br><br>other funeral music.  Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness<br><br>of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the<br><br>French call him REQUIN.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual<br><br>wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all<br><br>imaginations?  Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God's great,<br><br>unflattering laureate, Nature.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*I remember the first albatross I ever saw.  It was during a<br><br>prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas.  From my<br><br>forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there,<br><br>dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of<br><br>unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime.  At<br><br>intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace<br><br>some holy ark.  Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it.  Though<br><br>bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost in<br><br>supernatural distress.  Through its inexpressible, strange eyes,<br><br>methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.  As Abraham<br><br>before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its<br><br>wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the<br><br>miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns.  Long I gazed<br><br>at that prodigy of plumage.  I cannot tell, can only hint, the things<br><br>that darted through me then.  But at last I awoke; and turning, asked<br><br>a sailor what bird was this.  A goney, he replied.  Goney! never had<br><br>heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is<br><br>utterly unknown to men ashore! never!  But some time after, I learned<br><br>that goney was some seaman's name for albatross.  So that by no<br><br>possibility could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with<br><br>those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon<br><br>our deck.  For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird<br><br>to be an albatross.  Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish<br><br>a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.<br><br><br><br>I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird<br><br>chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in<br><br>this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey<br><br>albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such<br><br>emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.<br><br><br><br>But how had the mystic thing been caught?  Whisper it not, and I will<br><br>tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the<br><br>sea.  At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered,<br><br>leathern tally round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and<br><br>then letting it escape.  But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant<br><br>for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join<br><br>the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of<br><br>the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,<br><br>large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a<br><br>thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage.  He was the<br><br>elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those<br><br>days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies.  At<br><br>their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which<br><br>every evening leads on the hosts of light.  The flashing cascade of<br><br>his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings<br><br>more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished<br><br>him.  A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen,<br><br>western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters<br><br>revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic<br><br>as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed.  Whether<br><br>marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts<br><br>that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether<br><br>with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon,<br><br>the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils<br><br>reddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented<br><br>himself, always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling<br><br>reverence and awe.  Nor can it be questioned from what stands on<br><br>legendary record of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual<br><br>whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that<br><br>this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at<br><br>the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.<br><br><br><br>But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that<br><br>accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and<br><br>Albatross.<br><br><br><br>What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often<br><br>shocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and<br><br>kin!  It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by<br><br>the name he bears.  The Albino is as well made as other men--has no<br><br>substantive deformity--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading<br><br>whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion.<br><br>Why should this be so?<br><br><br><br>Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but<br><br>not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this<br><br>crowning attribute of the terrible.  From its snowy aspect, the<br><br>gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White<br><br>Squall.  Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice<br><br>omitted so potent an auxiliary.  How wildly it heightens the effect<br><br>of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of<br><br>their faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their<br><br>bailiff in the market-place!<br><br><br><br>Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all<br><br>mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue.  It<br><br>cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of<br><br>the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering<br><br>there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of<br><br>consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here.  And<br><br>from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the<br><br>shroud in which we wrap them.  Nor even in our superstitions do we<br><br>fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts<br><br>rising in a milk-white fog--Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us<br><br>add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the<br><br>evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.<br><br><br><br>Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious<br><br>thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest<br><br>idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.<br><br><br><br>But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to<br><br>account for it?  To analyse it, would seem impossible.  Can we,<br><br>then, by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing<br><br>of whiteness--though for the time either wholly or in great part<br><br>stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught<br><br>fearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same<br><br>sorcery, however modified;--can we thus hope to light upon some<br><br>chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?<br><br><br><br>Let us try.  But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,<br><br>and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls.<br><br>And though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions<br><br>about to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few<br><br>perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore<br><br>may not be able to recall them now.<br><br><br><br>Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely<br><br>acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare<br><br>mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,<br><br>speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded<br><br>with new-fallen snow?  Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant<br><br>of the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a<br><br>White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?<br><br><br><br>Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and<br><br>kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White<br><br>Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an<br><br>untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its<br><br>neighbors--the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?  And those sublimer<br><br>towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar<br><br>moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare<br><br>mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is<br><br>full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess?  Or why, irrespective of<br><br>all latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert<br><br>such a spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea<br><br>lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on<br><br>the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets?<br><br>Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to<br><br>the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,<br><br>does "the tall pale man" of the Hartz forests, whose changeless<br><br>pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves--why is<br><br>this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the<br><br>Blocksburg?<br><br><br><br>Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling<br><br>earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the<br><br>tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her<br><br>wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all<br><br>adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban<br><br>avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack<br><br>of cards;--it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the<br><br>strangest, saddest city thou can'st see.  For Lima has taken the<br><br>white veil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her<br><br>woe.  Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new;<br><br>admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over her<br><br>broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own<br><br>distortions.<br><br><br><br>I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness<br><br>is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of<br><br>objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there<br><br>aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind<br><br>almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when<br><br>exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or<br><br>universality.  What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be<br><br>respectively elucidated by the following examples.<br><br><br><br>First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if<br><br>by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels<br><br>just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under<br><br>precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock<br><br>to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky<br><br>whiteness--as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white<br><br>bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious<br><br>dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him<br><br>as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off<br><br>soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue<br><br>water is under him again.  Yet where is the mariner who will tell<br><br>thee, "Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as<br><br>the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?"<br><br><br><br>Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the<br><br>snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the<br><br>mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such<br><br>vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it<br><br>would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes.  Much the same is<br><br>it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative<br><br>indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no<br><br>shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.  Not<br><br>so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at<br><br>times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost<br><br>and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows<br><br>speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a boundless<br><br>churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and<br><br>splintered crosses.<br><br><br><br>But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is<br><br>but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a<br><br>hypo, Ishmael.<br><br><br><br>Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley<br><br>of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey--why is it that upon<br><br>the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him,<br><br>so that he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal<br><br>muskiness--why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the<br><br>ground in phrensies of affright?  There is no remembrance in him of<br><br>any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the<br><br>strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated<br><br>with the experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New<br><br>England colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?<br><br><br><br>No; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the<br><br>knowledge of the demonism in the world.  Though thousands of miles<br><br>from Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending,<br><br>goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the<br><br>prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.<br><br><br><br>Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings<br><br>of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the<br><br>windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the<br><br>shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!<br><br><br><br>Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the<br><br>mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt,<br><br>somewhere those things must exist.  Though in many of its aspects<br><br>this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were<br><br>formed in fright.<br><br><br><br>But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and<br><br>learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange<br><br>and far more portentous--why, as we have seen, it is at once the most<br><br>meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the<br><br>Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent<br><br>in things the most appalling to mankind.<br><br><br><br>Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids<br><br>and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with<br><br>the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the<br><br>milky way?  Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a<br><br>colour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the<br><br>concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a<br><br>dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows--a<br><br>colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink?  And when we<br><br>consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all<br><br>other earthly hues--every stately or lovely emblazoning--the sweet<br><br>tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of<br><br>butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are<br><br>but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only<br><br>laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints<br><br>like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the<br><br>charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that<br><br>the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great<br><br>principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself,<br><br>and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects,<br><br>even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge--pondering all this,<br><br>the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful<br><br>travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring<br><br>glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind<br><br>at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around<br><br>him.  And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol.<br><br>Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 43<br><br><br><br>Hark!<br><br><br><br><br><br>"HIST!  Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?<br><br><br><br>It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing<br><br>in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the<br><br>waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail.  In this manner, they<br><br>passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt.  Standing, for the most<br><br>part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were<br><br>careful not to speak or rustle their feet.  From hand to hand, the<br><br>buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional<br><br>flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.<br><br><br><br>It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,<br><br>whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a<br><br>Cholo, the words above.<br><br><br><br>"Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?"<br><br><br><br>"Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d'ye mean?"<br><br><br><br>"There it is again--under the hatches--don't you hear it--a cough--it<br><br>sounded like a cough."<br><br><br><br>"Cough be damned!  Pass along that return bucket."<br><br><br><br>"There again--there it is!--it sounds like two or three sleepers<br><br>turning over, now!"<br><br><br><br>"Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye?  It's the three soaked<br><br>biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye--nothing else.<br><br>Look to the bucket!"<br><br><br><br>"Say what ye will, shipmate; I've sharp ears."<br><br><br><br>"Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old<br><br>Quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;<br><br>you're the chap."<br><br><br><br>"Grin away; we'll see what turns up.  Hark ye, Cabaco, there is<br><br>somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck;<br><br>and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too.  I heard Stubb<br><br>tell Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort<br><br>in the wind."<br><br><br><br>"Tish! the bucket!"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 44<br><br><br><br>The Chart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall<br><br>that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his<br><br>purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the<br><br>transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea<br><br>charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table.  Then<br><br>seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the<br><br>various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but<br><br>steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were<br><br>blank.  At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside<br><br>him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on<br><br>various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been<br><br>captured or seen.<br><br><br><br>While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over<br><br>his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for<br><br>ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled<br><br>brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out<br><br>lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was<br><br>also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his<br><br>forehead.<br><br><br><br>But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his<br><br>cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.  Almost every night they<br><br>were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,<br><br>and others were substituted.  For with the charts of all four oceans<br><br>before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a<br><br>view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of<br><br>his soul.<br><br><br><br>Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,<br><br>it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary<br><br>creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.  But not so did it<br><br>seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and<br><br>thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and,<br><br>also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting<br><br>him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,<br><br>almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be<br><br>upon this or that ground in search of his prey.<br><br><br><br>So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the<br><br>sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe<br><br>that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;<br><br>were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully<br><br>collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to<br><br>correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the<br><br>flights of swallows.  On this hint, attempts have been made to<br><br>construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by<br><br>an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National<br><br>Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it<br><br>appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and<br><br>portions of it are presented in the circular.  "This chart divides<br><br>the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees<br><br>of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are<br><br>twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each<br><br>of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days<br><br>that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two<br><br>others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right,<br><br>have been seen."<br><br><br><br><br><br>Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,<br><br>the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather,<br><br>secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are<br><br>called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such<br><br>undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any<br><br>chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these<br><br>cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a<br><br>surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly<br><br>confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary<br><br>VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces<br><br>some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to<br><br>expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the<br><br>whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic<br><br>zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and<br><br>along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked<br><br>for.<br><br><br><br>And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate<br><br>feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in<br><br>crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,<br><br>by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to<br><br>be wholly without prospect of a meeting.<br><br><br><br>There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his<br><br>delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,<br><br>perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular<br><br>seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude<br><br>that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude<br><br>this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those<br><br>that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar<br><br>and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved<br><br>true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,<br><br>applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm<br><br>whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for<br><br>example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,<br><br>or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that<br><br>were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent<br><br>corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,<br><br>too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed<br><br>himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and<br><br>ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And<br><br>where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been<br><br>spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,<br><br>antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or<br><br>place were attained, when all possibilities would become<br><br>probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the<br><br>next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were<br><br>conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For<br><br>there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been<br><br>periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the<br><br>sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one<br><br>sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly<br><br>encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were<br><br>storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the<br><br>monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But<br><br>in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with<br><br>which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he<br><br>would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning<br><br>fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;<br><br>nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his<br><br>unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.<br><br><br><br>Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of<br><br>the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her<br><br>commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and<br><br>then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial<br><br>Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the<br><br>next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing<br><br>had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this<br><br>very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and<br><br>sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead<br><br>of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous<br><br>hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far<br><br>remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his<br><br>wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China<br><br>Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,<br><br>Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter<br><br>and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag<br><br>world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.<br><br><br><br>But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it<br><br>not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one<br><br>solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of<br><br>individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti<br><br>in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the<br><br>peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could<br><br>not but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab<br><br>would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long<br><br>after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,<br><br>and shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out<br><br>like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a<br><br>breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came<br><br>over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover<br><br>his strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure<br><br>who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.  He sleeps<br><br>with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his<br><br>palms.<br><br><br><br>Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably<br><br>vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts<br><br>through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and<br><br>whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till<br><br>the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and<br><br>when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved<br><br>his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from<br><br>which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends<br><br>beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself<br><br>yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and<br><br>with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though<br><br>escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of<br><br>being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright<br><br>at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.<br><br>For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast<br><br>hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,<br><br>was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror<br><br>again.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;<br><br>and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing<br><br>mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or<br><br>agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity<br><br>of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an<br><br>integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the<br><br>soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up<br><br>all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that<br><br>purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against<br><br>gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its<br><br>own.  Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to<br><br>which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and<br><br>unfathered birth.  Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of<br><br>bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the<br><br>time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of<br><br>living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and<br><br>therefore a blankness in itself.  God help thee, old man, thy<br><br>thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense<br><br>thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart<br><br>for ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 45<br><br><br><br>The Affidavit.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,<br><br>as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious<br><br>particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in<br><br>its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this<br><br>volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and<br><br>more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,<br><br>and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance<br><br>of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural<br><br>verity of the main points of this affair.<br><br><br><br>I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be<br><br>content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of<br><br>items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from<br><br>these citations, I take it--the conclusion aimed at will naturally<br><br>follow of itself.<br><br><br><br>First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after<br><br>receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an<br><br>interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by<br><br>the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same<br><br>private cypher, have been taken from the body.  In the instance where<br><br>three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and<br><br>I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted<br><br>them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage<br><br>to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and<br><br>penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of<br><br>nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers,<br><br>poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to<br><br>wandering in the heart of unknown regions.  Meanwhile, the whale he<br><br>had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice<br><br>circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of<br><br>Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came<br><br>together, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have<br><br>known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw<br><br>the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons<br><br>with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead<br><br>fish.  In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the<br><br>boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly<br><br>recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which<br><br>I had observed there three years previous.  I say three years, but I<br><br>am pretty sure it was more than that.  Here are three instances,<br><br>then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many<br><br>other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no<br><br>good ground to impeach.<br><br><br><br>Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however<br><br>ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several<br><br>memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean<br><br>has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable.  Why such<br><br>a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to<br><br>his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for<br><br>however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon<br><br>put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down<br><br>into a peculiarly valuable oil.  No: the reason was this: that from<br><br>the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige<br><br>of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo<br><br>Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him<br><br>by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered<br><br>lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more<br><br>intimate acquaintance.  Like some poor devils ashore that happen to<br><br>know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive<br><br>salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the<br><br>acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for their<br><br>presumption.<br><br><br><br>But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual<br><br>celebrity--Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he<br><br>famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,<br><br>but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions<br><br>of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar.  Was it<br><br>not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg,<br><br>who so long did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose<br><br>spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay?  Was it not so, O<br><br>New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their<br><br>wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land?  Was it not so, O Morquan!<br><br>King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the<br><br>semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?  Was it not so, O<br><br>Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise with<br><br>mystic hieroglyphics upon the back!  In plain prose, here are four<br><br>whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or<br><br>Sylla to the classic scholar.<br><br><br><br>But this is not all.  New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at<br><br>various times creating great havoc among the boats of different<br><br>vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out,<br><br>chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their<br><br>anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out<br><br>through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his<br><br>mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost<br><br>warrior of the Indian King Philip.<br><br><br><br>I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make<br><br>mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in<br><br>printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the<br><br>whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe.  For<br><br>this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires<br><br>full as much bolstering as error.  So ignorant are most landsmen of<br><br>some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that<br><br>without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and<br><br>otherwise, of the fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a<br><br>monstrous fable, or still worse and more detestable, a hideous and<br><br>intolerable allegory.<br><br><br><br>First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general<br><br>perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed,<br><br>vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they<br><br>recur.  One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual<br><br>disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a<br><br>public record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten<br><br>that record.  Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this<br><br>moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea,<br><br>is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding<br><br>leviathan--do you suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear in<br><br>the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast?<br><br>No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea.<br><br>In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct<br><br>or indirect from New Guinea?  Yet I tell you that upon one particular<br><br>voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty<br><br>different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some<br><br>of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat's crew.<br><br>For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a<br><br>gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was spilled for<br><br>it.<br><br><br><br>Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale<br><br>is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that<br><br>when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold<br><br>enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my<br><br>facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of<br><br>being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues<br><br>of Egypt.<br><br><br><br>But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon<br><br>testimony entirely independent of my own.  That point is this: The<br><br>Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and<br><br>judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in,<br><br>utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm<br><br>Whale HAS done it.<br><br><br><br>First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of<br><br>Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean.  One day she saw<br><br>spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales.<br><br>Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very<br><br>large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore<br><br>directly down upon the ship.  Dashing his forehead against her hull,<br><br>he so stove her in, that in less than "ten minutes" she settled down<br><br>and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.<br><br>After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in<br><br>their boats.  Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more<br><br>sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods<br><br>shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second<br><br>time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he<br><br>has never tempted it since.  At this day Captain Pollard is a<br><br>resident of Nantucket.  I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of<br><br>the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and<br><br>faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this<br><br>within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: "Every fact<br><br>seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance<br><br>which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the<br><br>ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to<br><br>their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being<br><br>made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for<br><br>the shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were<br><br>necessary.  His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated<br><br>resentment and fury.  He came directly from the shoal which we had<br><br>just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his<br><br>companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings."  Again:<br><br>"At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening<br><br>before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my<br><br>mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many<br><br>of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied<br><br>that I am correct in my opinion."<br><br><br><br>Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a<br><br>black night an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any<br><br>hospitable shore.  "The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing;<br><br>the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed<br><br>upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful<br><br>contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the<br><br>dismal looking wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,<br><br>wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its<br><br>appearance."<br><br><br><br>In another place--p. 45,--he speaks of "THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL<br><br>ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL."<br><br><br><br><br><br>Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807<br><br>totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic<br><br>particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,<br><br>though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual<br><br>allusions to it.<br><br><br><br>Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then<br><br>commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to<br><br>be dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship<br><br>in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.  Conversation turning upon<br><br>whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the<br><br>amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen<br><br>present.  He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so<br><br>smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a<br><br>thimbleful.  Very good; but there is more coming.  Some weeks after,<br><br>the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso.  But<br><br>he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few<br><br>moments' confidential business with him.  That business consisted in<br><br>fetching the Commodore's craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps<br><br>going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair.<br><br>I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore's interview<br><br>with that whale as providential.  Was not Saul of Tarsus converted<br><br>from unbelief by a similar fright?  I tell you, the sperm whale will<br><br>stand no nonsense.<br><br><br><br>I will now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a little<br><br>circumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.<br><br>Langsdorff, you must know by the way, was attached to the Russian<br><br>Admiral Krusenstern's famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of<br><br>the present century.  Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth<br><br>chapter:<br><br><br><br>"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next<br><br>day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather<br><br>was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged<br><br>to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;<br><br>it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest<br><br>sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger<br><br>than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was<br><br>not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,<br><br>which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was<br><br>impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed<br><br>in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up<br><br>its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The<br><br>masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below<br><br>all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck<br><br>upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with<br><br>the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately<br><br>to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any<br><br>damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped<br><br>entirely uninjured."<br><br><br><br>Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in<br><br>question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual<br><br>adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of<br><br>Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.<br><br>I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in<br><br>Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by<br><br>no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,<br><br>and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he<br><br>sailed from home.<br><br><br><br>In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,<br><br>too, of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient<br><br>Dampier's old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that<br><br>just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here<br><br>for a corroborative example, if such be needed.<br><br><br><br>Lionel, it seems, was on his way to "John Ferdinando," as he calls<br><br>the modern Juan Fernandes.  "In our way thither," he says, "about<br><br>four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty<br><br>leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,<br><br>which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell<br><br>where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for<br><br>death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we<br><br>took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the<br><br>amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found<br><br>no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in<br><br>their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their<br><br>hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown<br><br>out of his cabin!"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an<br><br>earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that<br><br>a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great<br><br>mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in<br><br>the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after<br><br>all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from<br><br>beneath.<br><br><br><br>I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known<br><br>to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In<br><br>more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the<br><br>assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,<br><br>and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The<br><br>English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for<br><br>his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the<br><br>lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been<br><br>transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her<br><br>great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.<br><br>Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once<br><br>struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with<br><br>blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his<br><br>pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his<br><br>character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his<br><br>mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive<br><br>minutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding<br><br>illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you<br><br>will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in<br><br>this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that<br><br>these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so<br><br>that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is<br><br>nothing new under the sun.<br><br><br><br>In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian<br><br>magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor<br><br>and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his<br><br>own times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best<br><br>authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and<br><br>unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not<br><br>at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.<br><br><br><br>Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term<br><br>of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured<br><br>in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having<br><br>destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more<br><br>than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot<br><br>easily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what<br><br>precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he<br><br>destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a<br><br>whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will<br><br>tell you why.  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had<br><br>been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters<br><br>connecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,<br><br>and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a<br><br>place for his habitual gregarious resort.  But further investigations<br><br>have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been<br><br>isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the<br><br>Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary<br><br>coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a<br><br>sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the<br><br>Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out<br><br>of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.<br><br><br><br>In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar<br><br>substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.<br><br>But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm<br><br>whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because<br><br>large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been<br><br>found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements<br><br>together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,<br><br>according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for<br><br>half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all<br><br>probability have been a sperm whale.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 46<br><br><br><br>Surmises.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his<br><br>thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby<br><br>Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to<br><br>that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature<br><br>and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways,<br><br>altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or<br><br>at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives<br><br>much more influential with him.  It would be refining too much,<br><br>perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his<br><br>vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended<br><br>itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters<br><br>he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each<br><br>subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he<br><br>hunted.  But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there<br><br>were still additional considerations which, though not so strictly<br><br>according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no<br><br>means incapable of swaying him.<br><br><br><br>To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used<br><br>in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.  He<br><br>knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some<br><br>respects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the<br><br>complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority<br><br>involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the<br><br>intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.  Starbuck's<br><br>body and Starbuck's coerced will were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept<br><br>his magnet at Starbuck's brain; still he knew that for all this the<br><br>chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain's quest, and could he,<br><br>would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it.<br><br>It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was<br><br>seen.  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall<br><br>into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,<br><br>unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were<br><br>brought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of<br><br>Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested<br><br>than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for<br><br>the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange<br><br>imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full<br><br>terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure<br><br>background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted<br><br>meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long<br><br>night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to<br><br>think of than Moby Dick.  For however eagerly and impetuously the<br><br>savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors<br><br>of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable--they live in<br><br>the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness--and when<br><br>retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however<br><br>promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things<br><br>requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene<br><br>and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.<br><br><br><br>Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of strong emotion<br><br>mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are<br><br>evanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the<br><br>manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.  Granting that the<br><br>White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and<br><br>playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous<br><br>knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give<br><br>chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common,<br><br>daily appetites.  For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of<br><br>old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to<br><br>fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,<br><br>picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way.  Had<br><br>they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object--that<br><br>final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in<br><br>disgust.  I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of<br><br>cash--aye, cash.  They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by,<br><br>and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same<br><br>quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would<br><br>soon cashier Ahab.<br><br><br><br>Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related<br><br>to Ahab personally.  Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps<br><br>somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the<br><br>Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,<br><br>he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of<br><br>usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew<br><br>if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further<br><br>obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command.<br><br>From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the<br><br>possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground,<br><br>Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself.  That<br><br>protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and<br><br>heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to<br><br>every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew<br><br>to be subjected to.<br><br><br><br>For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be<br><br>verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a<br><br>good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the<br><br>Pequod's voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but<br><br>force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the<br><br>general pursuit of his profession.<br><br><br><br>Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the<br><br>three mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and<br><br>not omit reporting even a porpoise.  This vigilance was not long<br><br>without reward.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 47<br><br><br><br>The Mat-Maker.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging<br><br>about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured<br><br>waters.  Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a<br><br>sword-mat, for an additional lashing to our boat.  So still and<br><br>subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an<br><br>incantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent sailor<br><br>seemed resolved into his own invisible self.<br><br><br><br>I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat.  As I<br><br>kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the<br><br>long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as<br><br>Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword<br><br>between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly<br><br>and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a<br><br>dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the<br><br>sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it<br><br>seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle<br><br>mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates.  There lay the<br><br>fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning,<br><br>unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of<br><br>the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.  This warp<br><br>seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own<br><br>shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads.<br><br>Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting<br><br>the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the<br><br>case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow<br><br>producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the<br><br>completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally<br><br>shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword<br><br>must be chance--aye, chance, free will, and necessity--nowise<br><br>incompatible--all interweavingly working together.  The straight warp<br><br>of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course--its every<br><br>alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still<br><br>free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though<br><br>restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and<br><br>sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed<br><br>to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring<br><br>blow at events.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so<br><br>strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball<br><br>of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the<br><br>clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing.  High aloft in the<br><br>cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego.  His body was reaching<br><br>eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief<br><br>sudden intervals he continued his cries.  To be sure the same sound<br><br>was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from<br><br>hundreds of whalemen's look-outs perched as high in the air; but from<br><br>few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a<br><br>marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian's.<br><br><br><br>As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and<br><br>eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some<br><br>prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild<br><br>cries announcing their coming.<br><br><br><br>"There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!"<br><br><br><br>"Where-away?"<br><br><br><br>"On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!"<br><br><br><br>Instantly all was commotion.<br><br><br><br>The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and<br><br>reliable uniformity.  And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from<br><br>other tribes of his genus.<br><br><br><br>"There go flukes!" was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales<br><br>disappeared.<br><br><br><br>"Quick, steward!" cried Ahab.  "Time! time!"<br><br><br><br>Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact<br><br>minute to Ahab.<br><br><br><br>The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling<br><br>before it.  Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading<br><br>to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in<br><br>advance of our bows.  For that singular craft at times evinced by the<br><br>Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he<br><br>nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and<br><br>swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter--this deceitfulness of his<br><br>could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that<br><br>the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew<br><br>at all of our vicinity.  One of the men selected for<br><br>shipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time<br><br>relieved the Indian at the main-mast head.  The sailors at the fore<br><br>and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places;<br><br>the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three<br><br>boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high<br><br>cliffs.  Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand<br><br>clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the<br><br>gunwale.  So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw<br><br>themselves on board an enemy's ship.<br><br><br><br>But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took<br><br>every eye from the whale.  With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who<br><br>was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of<br><br>air.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 48<br><br><br><br>The First Lowering.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other<br><br>side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose<br><br>the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there.  This boat had<br><br>always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called<br><br>the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter.<br><br>The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one<br><br>white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips.  A rumpled<br><br>Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide<br><br>black trowsers of the same dark stuff.  But strangely crowning this<br><br>ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair<br><br>braided and coiled round and round upon his head.  Less swart in<br><br>aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,<br><br>tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of<br><br>the Manillas;--a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty,<br><br>and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and<br><br>secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord,<br><br>whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.<br><br><br><br>While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these<br><br>strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their<br><br>head, "All ready there, Fedallah?"<br><br><br><br>"Ready," was the half-hissed reply.<br><br><br><br>"Lower away then; d'ye hear?" shouting across the deck.  "Lower away<br><br>there, I say."<br><br><br><br>Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the<br><br>men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks;<br><br>with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a<br><br>dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the<br><br>sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the<br><br>tossed boats below.<br><br><br><br>Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth<br><br>keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern,<br><br>and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the<br><br>stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves<br><br>widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.  But with all their<br><br>eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates<br><br>of the other boats obeyed not the command.<br><br><br><br>"Captain Ahab?--" said Starbuck.<br><br><br><br>"Spread yourselves," cried Ahab; "give way, all four boats.  Thou,<br><br>Flask, pull out more to leeward!"<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye, sir," cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his<br><br>great steering oar.  "Lay back!" addressing his crew.<br><br>"There!--there!--there again!  There she blows right ahead,<br><br>boys!--lay back!"<br><br><br><br>"Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy."<br><br><br><br>"Oh, I don't mind'em, sir," said Archy; "I knew it all before now.<br><br>Didn't I hear 'em in the hold?  And didn't I tell Cabaco here of it?<br><br>What say ye, Cabaco?  They are stowaways, Mr. Flask."<br><br><br><br>"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little<br><br>ones," drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of<br><br>whom still showed signs of uneasiness.  "Why don't you break your<br><br>backbones, my boys?  What is it you stare at?  Those chaps in yonder<br><br>boat?  Tut!  They are only five more hands come to help us--never<br><br>mind from where--the more the merrier.  Pull, then, do pull; never<br><br>mind the brimstone--devils are good fellows enough.  So, so; there<br><br>you are now; that's the stroke for a thousand pounds; that's the<br><br>stroke to sweep the stakes!  Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my<br><br>heroes!  Three cheers, men--all hearts alive!  Easy, easy; don't be<br><br>in a hurry--don't be in a hurry.  Why don't you snap your oars, you<br><br>rascals?  Bite something, you dogs!  So, so, so, then:--softly,<br><br>softly!  That's it--that's it! long and strong.  Give way there, give<br><br>way!  The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all<br><br>asleep.  Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.  Pull, will ye? pull,<br><br>can't ye? pull, won't ye?  Why in the name of gudgeons and<br><br>ginger-cakes don't ye pull?--pull and break something! pull, and<br><br>start your eyes out!  Here!" whipping out the sharp knife from his<br><br>girdle; "every mother's son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the<br><br>blade between his teeth.  That's it--that's it.  Now ye do something;<br><br>that looks like it, my steel-bits.  Start her--start her, my<br><br>silver-spoons!  Start her, marling-spikes!"<br><br><br><br>Stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had<br><br>rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially<br><br>in inculcating the religion of rowing.  But you must not suppose from<br><br>this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright<br><br>passions with his congregation.  Not at all; and therein consisted<br><br>his chief peculiarity.  He would say the most terrific things to his<br><br>crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury<br><br>seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman<br><br>could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and<br><br>yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.  Besides he all the time<br><br>looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his<br><br>steering-oar, and so broadly gaped--open-mouthed at times--that the<br><br>mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast,<br><br>acted like a charm upon the crew.  Then again, Stubb was one of those<br><br>odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously<br><br>ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of<br><br>obeying them.<br><br><br><br>In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely<br><br>across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were<br><br>pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.<br><br><br><br>"Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye<br><br>please!"<br><br><br><br>"Halloa!" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he<br><br>spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set<br><br>like a flint from Stubb's.<br><br><br><br>"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!<br><br><br><br>"Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,<br><br>boys!)" in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: "A<br><br>sad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never<br><br>mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best.  Let all your crew pull strong,<br><br>come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There's hogsheads of sperm<br><br>ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that's what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!)<br><br>Sperm, sperm's the play!  This at least is duty; duty and profit hand<br><br>in hand."<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye, I thought as much," soliloquized Stubb, when the boats<br><br>diverged, "as soon as I clapt eye on 'em, I thought so.  Aye, and<br><br>that's what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy<br><br>long suspected.  They were hidden down there.  The White Whale's at<br><br>the bottom of it.  Well, well, so be it!  Can't be helped!  All<br><br>right!  Give way, men!  It ain't the White Whale to-day!  Give way!"<br><br><br><br>Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical<br><br>instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not<br><br>unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of<br><br>the ship's company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time<br><br>previous got abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this<br><br>had in some small measure prepared them for the event.  It took off<br><br>the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all this and<br><br>Stubb's confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were<br><br>for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though the affair<br><br>still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to<br><br>dark Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning.  For me,<br><br>I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on<br><br>board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the<br><br>enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.<br><br><br><br>Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the<br><br>furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a<br><br>circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him.  Those<br><br>tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like<br><br>five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of<br><br>strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a<br><br>horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer.  As for<br><br>Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown<br><br>aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole<br><br>part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the<br><br>alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end<br><br>of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer's, thrown half backward<br><br>into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was<br><br>seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat<br><br>lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him.  All at once the<br><br>outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,<br><br>while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.  Boat and<br><br>crew sat motionless on the sea.  Instantly the three spread boats in<br><br>the rear paused on their way.  The whales had irregularly settled<br><br>bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token<br><br>of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed<br><br>it.<br><br><br><br>"Every man look out along his oars!" cried Starbuck.  "Thou,<br><br>Queequeg, stand up!"<br><br><br><br>Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the<br><br>savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off<br><br>towards the spot where the chase had last been descried.  Likewise<br><br>upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly<br><br>platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly<br><br>and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of<br><br>a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.<br><br><br><br>Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still;<br><br>its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a<br><br>stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above<br><br>the level of the stern platform.  It is used for catching turns with<br><br>the whale line.  Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a<br><br>man's hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed<br><br>perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her<br><br>trucks.  But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same<br><br>time little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that<br><br>this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.<br><br><br><br>"I can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to<br><br>that."<br><br><br><br>Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his<br><br>way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his<br><br>lofty shoulders for a pedestal.<br><br><br><br>"Good a mast-head as any, sir.  Will you mount?"<br><br><br><br>"That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you<br><br>fifty feet taller."<br><br><br><br>Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the<br><br>boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm<br><br>to Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed<br><br>head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one<br><br>dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders.<br><br>And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm<br><br>furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself<br><br>by.<br><br><br><br>At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what<br><br>wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an<br><br>erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most<br><br>riotously perverse and cross-running seas.  Still more strange to see<br><br>him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such<br><br>circumstances.  But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic<br><br>Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool,<br><br>indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to<br><br>every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form.  On his<br><br>broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake.  The bearer<br><br>looked nobler than the rider.  Though truly vivacious, tumultuous,<br><br>ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience;<br><br>but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly<br><br>chest.  So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living<br><br>magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her<br><br>seasons for that.<br><br><br><br>Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing<br><br>solicitudes.  The whales might have made one of their regular<br><br>soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were<br><br>the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to<br><br>solace the languishing interval with his pipe.  He withdrew it from<br><br>his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather.  He<br><br>loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly<br><br>had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand,<br><br>when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to<br><br>windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his<br><br>erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry,<br><br>"Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!"<br><br><br><br>To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been<br><br>visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white<br><br>water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and<br><br>suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white<br><br>rolling billows.  The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it<br><br>were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.  Beneath<br><br>this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin<br><br>layer of water, also, the whales were swimming.  Seen in advance of<br><br>all the other indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed<br><br>their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.<br><br><br><br>All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled<br><br>water and air.  But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on,<br><br>as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the<br><br>hills.<br><br><br><br>"Pull, pull, my good boys," said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but<br><br>intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed<br><br>glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed<br><br>as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.  He did<br><br>not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to<br><br>him.  Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly<br><br>pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now<br><br>soft with entreaty.<br><br><br><br>How different the loud little King-Post.  "Sing out and say<br><br>something, my hearties.  Roar and pull, my thunderbolts!  Beach me,<br><br>beach me on their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I'll<br><br>sign over to you my Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys; including<br><br>wife and children, boys.  Lay me on--lay me on!  O Lord, Lord! but I<br><br>shall go stark, staring mad!  See! see that white water!"  And so<br><br>shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and down on<br><br>it; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally<br><br>fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's stern like a crazed colt<br><br>from the prairie.<br><br><br><br>"Look at that chap now," philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his<br><br>unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a<br><br>short distance, followed after--"He's got fits, that Flask has.<br><br>Fits? yes, give him fits--that's the very word--pitch fits into 'em.<br><br>Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive.  Pudding for supper, you<br><br>know;--merry's the word.  Pull, babes--pull, sucklings--pull, all.<br><br>But what the devil are you hurrying about?  Softly, softly, and<br><br>steadily, my men.  Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more.  Crack<br><br>all your backbones, and bite your knives in two--that's all.  Take it<br><br>easy--why don't ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and<br><br>lungs!"<br><br><br><br>But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew<br><br>of his--these were words best omitted here; for you live under the<br><br>blessed light of the evangelical land.  Only the infidel sharks in<br><br>the audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado<br><br>brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after<br><br>his prey.<br><br><br><br>Meanwhile, all the boats tore on.  The repeated specific allusions of<br><br>Flask to "that whale," as he called the fictitious monster which he<br><br>declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its<br><br>tail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like,<br><br>that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful<br><br>look over the shoulder.  But this was against all rule; for the<br><br>oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their<br><br>necks; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and<br><br>no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.<br><br><br><br>It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe!  The vast swells of the<br><br>omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled<br><br>along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless<br><br>bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip<br><br>for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that<br><br>almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip<br><br>into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to<br><br>gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down<br><br>its other side;--all these, with the cries of the headsmen and<br><br>harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the<br><br>wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with<br><br>outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;--all<br><br>this was thrilling.<br><br><br><br>Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the<br><br>fever heat of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost encountering<br><br>the first unknown phantom in the other world;--neither of these can<br><br>feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the<br><br>first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of<br><br>the hunted sperm whale.<br><br><br><br>The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and<br><br>more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun<br><br>cloud-shadows flung upon the sea.  The jets of vapour no longer<br><br>blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed<br><br>separating their wakes.  The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck<br><br>giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.  Our sail was<br><br>now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat<br><br>going with such madness through the water, that the lee oars could<br><br>scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the<br><br>row-locks.<br><br><br><br>Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither<br><br>ship nor boat to be seen.<br><br><br><br>"Give way, men," whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the<br><br>sheet of his sail; "there is time to kill a fish yet before the<br><br>squall comes.  There's white water again!--close to!  Spring!"<br><br><br><br>Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted<br><br>that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard,<br><br>when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: "Stand<br><br>up!" and Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.<br><br><br><br>Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death<br><br>peril so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense<br><br>countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the<br><br>imminent instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing<br><br>sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.  Meanwhile the<br><br>boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and<br><br>hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.<br><br><br><br>"That's his hump.  THERE, THERE, give it to him!" whispered Starbuck.<br><br><br><br>A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron<br><br>of Queequeg.  Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push<br><br>from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the<br><br>sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near<br><br>by; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us.  The<br><br>whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter<br><br>into the white curdling cream of the squall.  Squall, whale, and<br><br>harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the<br><br>iron, escaped.<br><br><br><br>Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.  Swimming<br><br>round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the<br><br>gunwale, tumbled back to our places.  There we sat up to our knees in<br><br>the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our<br><br>downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up<br><br>to us from the bottom of the ocean.<br><br><br><br>The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers<br><br>together; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us<br><br>like a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were<br><br>burning; immortal in these jaws of death!  In vain we hailed the<br><br>other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a<br><br>flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.  Meanwhile the<br><br>driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;<br><br>no sign of the ship could be seen.  The rising sea forbade all<br><br>attempts to bale out the boat.  The oars were useless as propellers,<br><br>performing now the office of life-preservers.  So, cutting the<br><br>lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck<br><br>contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a<br><br>waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this<br><br>forlorn hope.  There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle<br><br>in the heart of that almighty forlornness.  There, then, he sat, the<br><br>sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in<br><br>the midst of despair.<br><br><br><br>Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or<br><br>boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on.  The mist still<br><br>spread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of<br><br>the boat.  Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand<br><br>to his ear.  We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards<br><br>hitherto muffled by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the<br><br>thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we<br><br>all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing<br><br>right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its<br><br>length.<br><br><br><br>Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant<br><br>it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base<br><br>of a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen<br><br>no more till it came up weltering astern.  Again we swam for it, were<br><br>dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely<br><br>landed on board.  Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had<br><br>cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.  The<br><br>ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light<br><br>upon some token of our perishing,--an oar or a lance pole.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 49<br><br><br><br>The Hyena.<br><br><br><br><br><br>There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed<br><br>affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast<br><br>practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and<br><br>more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own.<br><br>However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing.<br><br>He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions,<br><br>all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an<br><br>ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints.

That odd sort of<br><br>wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of<br><br>extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness,<br><br>so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most<br><br>momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke.  There is<br><br>nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort<br><br>of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this<br><br>whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.<br><br><br><br>"Queequeg," said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the<br><br>deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the<br><br>water; "Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often<br><br>happen?"  Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me,<br><br>he gave me to understand that such things did often happen.<br><br><br><br>"Mr. Stubb," said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his<br><br>oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; "Mr. Stubb,<br><br>I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our<br><br>chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent.  I<br><br>suppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set<br><br>in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion?"<br><br><br><br>"Certain.  I've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off<br><br>Cape Horn."<br><br><br><br>"Mr. Flask," said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing<br><br>close by; "you are experienced in these things, and I am not.  Will<br><br>you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr.<br><br>Flask, for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself<br><br>back-foremost into death's jaws?"<br><br><br><br>"Can't you twist that smaller?" said Flask.  "Yes, that's the law.  I<br><br>should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale face<br><br>foremost.  Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind<br><br>that!"<br><br><br><br>Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate<br><br>statement of the entire case.  Considering, therefore, that squalls<br><br>and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep,<br><br>were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life; considering<br><br>that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I<br><br>must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the<br><br>boat--oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his<br><br>impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own<br><br>frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster to our<br><br>own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving<br><br>on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that<br><br>Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in<br><br>the fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent<br><br>Starbuck's boat; and finally considering in what a devil's chase I<br><br>was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things together,<br><br>I say, I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of<br><br>my will.  "Queequeg," said I, "come along, you shall be my lawyer,<br><br>executor, and legatee."<br><br><br><br>It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at<br><br>their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world<br><br>more fond of that diversion.  This was the fourth time in my nautical<br><br>life that I had done the same thing.  After the ceremony was<br><br>concluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone<br><br>was rolled away from my heart.  Besides, all the days I should now<br><br>live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his<br><br>resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks<br><br>as the case might be.  I survived myself; my death and burial were<br><br>locked up in my chest.  I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly,<br><br>like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of<br><br>a snug family vault.<br><br><br><br>Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my<br><br>frock, here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction,<br><br>and the devil fetch the hindmost.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 50<br><br><br><br>Ahab's Boat and Crew.  Fedallah.<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Who would have thought it, Flask!" cried Stubb; "if I had but one<br><br>leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the<br><br>plug-hole with my timber toe.  Oh! he's a wonderful old man!"<br><br><br><br>"I don't think it so strange, after all, on that account," said<br><br>Flask.  "If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different<br><br>thing.  That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of<br><br>the other left, you know."<br><br><br><br>"I don't know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel."<br><br><br><br><br><br>Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering<br><br>the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it<br><br>is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active<br><br>perils of the chase.  So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears<br><br>in their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be<br><br>carried into the thickest of the fight.<br><br><br><br>But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.  Considering<br><br>that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of<br><br>danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great<br><br>and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed,<br><br>then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any<br><br>maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?  As a general thing,<br><br>the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.<br><br><br><br>Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little<br><br>of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes<br><br>of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and<br><br>giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat<br><br>actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above<br><br>all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same<br><br>boat's crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the<br><br>heads of the owners of the Pequod.  Therefore he had not solicited a<br><br>boat's crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on<br><br>that head.  Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own<br><br>touching all that matter.  Until Cabaco's published discovery, the<br><br>sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a<br><br>little while out of port, all hands had concluded the customary<br><br>business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time after<br><br>this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of<br><br>making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one<br><br>of the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden<br><br>skewers, which when the line is running out are pinned over the<br><br>groove in the bow: when all this was observed in him, and<br><br>particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in<br><br>the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed<br><br>pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in<br><br>exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes<br><br>called, the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the knee<br><br>against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how<br><br>often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the<br><br>semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter's<br><br>chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there;<br><br>all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at<br><br>the time.  But almost everybody supposed that this particular<br><br>preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the<br><br>ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his<br><br>intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.  But such a<br><br>supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any<br><br>boat's crew being assigned to that boat.<br><br><br><br>Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned<br><br>away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane.  Besides, now and then such<br><br>unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the<br><br>unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating<br><br>outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer<br><br>castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits<br><br>of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and<br><br>what not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step<br><br>down into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create<br><br>any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.<br><br><br><br>But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate<br><br>phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it<br><br>were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah<br><br>remained a muffled mystery to the last.  Whence he came in a mannerly<br><br>world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced<br><br>himself to be linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to<br><br>have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might<br><br>have been even authority over him; all this none knew.  But one<br><br>cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah.  He was such a<br><br>creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see<br><br>in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and<br><br>then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the<br><br>Oriental isles to the east of the continent--those insulated,<br><br>immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days<br><br>still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth's primal<br><br>generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct<br><br>recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came,<br><br>eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon<br><br>why they were created and to what end; when though, according to<br><br>Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the<br><br>devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 51<br><br><br><br>The Spirit-Spout.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly<br><br>swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off<br><br>the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of<br><br>the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery<br><br>locality, southerly from St. Helena.<br><br><br><br>It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and<br><br>moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;<br><br>and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery<br><br>silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was<br><br>seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow.  Lit up by the<br><br>moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god<br><br>uprising from the sea.  Fedallah first descried this jet.  For of<br><br>these moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast<br><br>head, and stand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it<br><br>had been day.  And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night,<br><br>not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them.  You<br><br>may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old<br><br>Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the<br><br>moon, companions in one sky.  But when, after spending his uniform<br><br>interval there for several successive nights without uttering a<br><br>single sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was<br><br>heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner<br><br>started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the<br><br>rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.  "There she blows!"  Had the<br><br>trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still<br><br>they felt no terror; rather pleasure.  For though it was a most<br><br>unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously<br><br>exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a<br><br>lowering.<br><br><br><br>Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the<br><br>t'gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread.  The<br><br>best man in the ship must take the helm.  Then, with every mast-head<br><br>manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind.  The strange,<br><br>upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the<br><br>hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel<br><br>like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two<br><br>antagonistic influences were struggling in her--one to mount direct<br><br>to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal.  And<br><br>had you watched Ahab's face that night, you would have thought that<br><br>in him also two different things were warring.  While his one live<br><br>leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb<br><br>sounded like a coffin-tap.  On life and death this old man walked.<br><br>But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like<br><br>arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen<br><br>that night.  Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second<br><br>time.<br><br><br><br>This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some<br><br>days after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced:<br><br>again it was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it,<br><br>once more it disappeared as if it had never been.  And so it served<br><br>us night after night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it.<br><br>Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the<br><br>case might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or<br><br>three; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be<br><br>advancing still further and further in our van, this solitary jet<br><br>seemed for ever alluring us on.<br><br><br><br>Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance<br><br>with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things<br><br>invested the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore<br><br>that whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in<br><br>however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was<br><br>cast by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick.  For a time,<br><br>there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting<br><br>apparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in<br><br>order that the monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last<br><br>in the remotest and most savage seas.<br><br><br><br>These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a<br><br>wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in<br><br>which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a<br><br>devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas<br><br>so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our<br><br>vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like<br><br>prow.<br><br><br><br>But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began<br><br>howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas<br><br>that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the<br><br>blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of<br><br>silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this<br><br>desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more<br><br>dismal than before.<br><br><br><br>Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and<br><br>thither before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable<br><br>sea-ravens.  And every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these<br><br>birds were seen; and spite of our hootings, for a long time<br><br>obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship some<br><br>drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and<br><br>therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves.  And heaved<br><br>and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast<br><br>tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul were in anguish<br><br>and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.<br><br><br><br>Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye?  Rather Cape Tormentoto, as<br><br>called of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that<br><br>before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this<br><br>tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and<br><br>these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any<br><br>haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon.  But<br><br>calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of<br><br>feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary<br><br>jet would at times be descried.<br><br><br><br>During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for<br><br>the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous<br><br>deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever<br><br>addressed his mates.  In tempestuous times like these, after<br><br>everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done<br><br>but passively to await the issue of the gale.  Then Captain and crew<br><br>become practical fatalists.  So, with his ivory leg inserted into its<br><br>accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for<br><br>hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an<br><br>occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very<br><br>eyelashes together.  Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part<br><br>of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,<br><br>stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to<br><br>guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a<br><br>sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a<br><br>loosened belt.  Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as<br><br>if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through<br><br>all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves.  By night<br><br>the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean<br><br>prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still<br><br>wordless Ahab stood up to the blast.  Even when wearied nature seemed<br><br>demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock.<br><br>Never could Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night<br><br>going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him<br><br>with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the<br><br>rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time<br><br>before emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and<br><br>coat.  On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of<br><br>tides and currents which have previously been spoken of.  His lantern<br><br>swung from his tightly clenched hand.  Though the body was erect, the<br><br>head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the<br><br>needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to<br><br>the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself<br><br>of the course of the ship.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this<br><br>gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 52<br><br><br><br>The Albatross.<br><br><br><br><br><br>South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good<br><br>cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney<br><br>(Albatross) by name.  As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at<br><br>the fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to<br><br>a tyro in the far ocean fisheries--a whaler at sea, and long absent<br><br>from home.<br><br><br><br>As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the<br><br>skeleton of a stranded walrus.  All down her sides, this spectral<br><br>appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all<br><br>her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees<br><br>furred over with hoar-frost.  Only her lower sails were set.  A wild<br><br>sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three<br><br>mast-heads.  They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and<br><br>bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of<br><br>cruising.  Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and<br><br>swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided<br><br>close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each<br><br>other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one<br><br>ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen,<br><br>mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own<br><br>look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.<br><br><br><br>"Ship ahoy!  Have ye seen the White Whale?"<br><br><br><br>But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in<br><br>the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his<br><br>hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove<br><br>to make himself heard without it.  Meantime his ship was still<br><br>increasing the distance between.  While in various silent ways<br><br>the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this<br><br>ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale's name<br><br>to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though<br><br>he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the<br><br>threatening wind forbade.  But taking advantage of his windward<br><br>position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that<br><br>the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he<br><br>loudly hailed--"Ahoy there!  This is the Pequod, bound round the<br><br>world!  Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean!<br><br>and this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address<br><br>them to--"<br><br><br><br>At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly,<br><br>then, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small<br><br>harmless fish, that for some days before had been placidly swimming<br><br>by our side, darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged<br><br>themselves fore and aft with the stranger's flanks.  Though in the<br><br>course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed<br><br>a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles<br><br>capriciously carry meanings.<br><br><br><br>"Swim away from me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the<br><br>water.  There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed<br><br>more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before<br><br>evinced.  But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding<br><br>the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old<br><br>lion voice,--"Up helm!  Keep her off round the world!"<br><br><br><br>Round the world!  There is much in that sound to inspire proud<br><br>feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct?  Only<br><br>through numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where<br><br>those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us.<br><br><br><br>Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could<br><br>for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and<br><br>strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were<br><br>promise in the voyage.  But in pursuit of those far mysteries we<br><br>dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time<br><br>or other, swims before all human hearts; while chasing such over this<br><br>round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave<br><br>us whelmed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 53<br><br><br><br>The Gam.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we<br><br>had spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms.  But even had<br><br>this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded<br><br>her--judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions--if so it<br><br>had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative<br><br>answer to the question he put.  For, as it eventually turned out, he<br><br>cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger<br><br>captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so<br><br>absorbingly sought.  But all this might remain inadequately<br><br>estimated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages of<br><br>whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas, and<br><br>especially on a common cruising-ground.<br><br><br><br>If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the<br><br>equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering<br><br>each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of<br><br>them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a<br><br>moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a<br><br>while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon<br><br>the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two<br><br>whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off<br><br>lone Fanning's Island, or the far away King's Mills; how much more<br><br>natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not<br><br>only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and<br><br>sociable contact.  And especially would this seem to be a matter of<br><br>course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose<br><br>captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to<br><br>each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things<br><br>to talk about.<br><br><br><br>For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters<br><br>on board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers<br><br>of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and<br><br>thumb-worn files.  And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound<br><br>ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the<br><br>cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost<br><br>importance to her.  And in degree, all this will hold true concerning<br><br>whaling vessels crossing each other's track on the cruising-ground<br><br>itself, even though they are equally long absent from home.  For one<br><br>of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and<br><br>now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the<br><br>people of the ship she now meets.  Besides, they would exchange the<br><br>whaling news, and have an agreeable chat.  For not only would they<br><br>meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the<br><br>peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually<br><br>shared privations and perils.<br><br><br><br>Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;<br><br>that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case<br><br>with Americans and English.  Though, to be sure, from the small<br><br>number of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and<br><br>when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between<br><br>them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he<br><br>does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.  Besides,<br><br>the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan<br><br>superiority over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean<br><br>Nantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of<br><br>sea-peasant.  But where this superiority in the English whalemen<br><br>does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees<br><br>in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the English,<br><br>collectively, in ten years.  But this is a harmless little foible in<br><br>the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much<br><br>to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles<br><br>himself.<br><br><br><br>So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the<br><br>whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so.  Whereas,<br><br>some merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic,<br><br>will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of<br><br>recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a<br><br>brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in<br><br>finical criticism upon each other's rig.  As for Men-of-War, when<br><br>they chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of<br><br>silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there<br><br>does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly<br><br>love about it at all.  As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are<br><br>in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as<br><br>possible.  And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other's<br><br>cross-bones, the first hail is--"How many skulls?"--the same way that<br><br>whalers hail--"How many barrels?"  And that question once answered,<br><br>pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on<br><br>both sides, and don't like to see overmuch of each other's villanous<br><br>likenesses.<br><br><br><br>But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,<br><br>free-and-easy whaler!  What does the whaler do when she meets another<br><br>whaler in any sort of decent weather?  She has a "GAM," a thing so<br><br>utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name<br><br>even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,<br><br>and repeat gamesome stuff about "spouters" and "blubber-boilers," and<br><br>such like pretty exclamations.  Why it is that all Merchant-seamen,<br><br>and also all Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors,<br><br>cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a<br><br>question it would be hard to answer.  Because, in the case of<br><br>pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs<br><br>has any peculiar glory about it.  It sometimes ends in uncommon<br><br>elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows.  And besides, when a man<br><br>is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his<br><br>superior altitude.  Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be<br><br>high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no<br><br>solid basis to stand on.<br><br><br><br>But what is a GAM?  You might wear out your index-finger running up<br><br>and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word.  Dr.<br><br>Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster's ark does not<br><br>hold it.  Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many<br><br>years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born<br><br>Yankees.  Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be<br><br>incorporated into the Lexicon.  With that view, let me learnedly<br><br>define it.<br><br><br><br>GAM.  NOUN--A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) WHALESHIPS, GENERALLY<br><br>ON A CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE<br><br>VISITS BY BOATS' CREWS; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON<br><br>BOARD OF ONE SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER.<br><br><br><br>There is another little item about Gamming which must not be<br><br>forgotten here.  All professions have their own little peculiarities<br><br>of detail; so has the whale fishery.  In a pirate, man-of-war, or<br><br>slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always<br><br>sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat<br><br>there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's<br><br>tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons.  But the whale-boat has<br><br>no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all.<br><br>High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water<br><br>on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.  And as for a<br><br>tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and<br><br>therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship,<br><br>and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that<br><br>subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,<br><br>having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing<br><br>like a pine tree.  And often you will notice that being conscious of<br><br>the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of<br><br>the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance<br><br>of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.  Nor is this any<br><br>very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering<br><br>oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar<br><br>reciprocating by rapping his knees in front.  He is thus completely<br><br>wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by<br><br>settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of<br><br>the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of<br><br>foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth.  Merely make a<br><br>spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.  Then,<br><br>again, it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes,<br><br>it would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen<br><br>steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything<br><br>with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command,<br><br>he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps<br><br>being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for<br><br>ballast.  Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well<br><br>authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an<br><br>uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say--to seize<br><br>hold of the nearest oarsman's hair, and hold on there like grim<br><br>death.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 54<br><br><br><br>The Town-Ho's Story.<br><br><br><br><br><br>(AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN)<br><br><br><br><br><br>The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there,<br><br>is much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you<br><br>meet more travellers than in any other part.<br><br><br><br>It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another<br><br>homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered.  She was<br><br>manned almost wholly by Polynesians.  In the short gam that ensued<br><br>she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.  To some the general interest<br><br>in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the<br><br>Town-Ho's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a<br><br>certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called<br><br>judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men.  This<br><br>latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming<br><br>what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be<br><br>narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates.  For<br><br>that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the<br><br>Town-Ho himself.  It was the private property of three confederate<br><br>white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to<br><br>Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night<br><br>Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that<br><br>way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.<br><br>Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those<br><br>seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by<br><br>such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this<br><br>matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never<br><br>transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast.  Interweaving in its proper<br><br>place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the<br><br>ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on<br><br>lasting record.<br><br><br><br><br><br>*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the<br><br>mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos<br><br>terrapin.<br><br><br><br><br><br>For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once<br><br>narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one<br><br>saint's eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden<br><br>Inn.  Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian,<br><br>were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions<br><br>they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.<br><br><br><br>"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am<br><br>about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of<br><br>Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days'<br><br>sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn.  She was<br><br>somewhere to the northward of the Line.  One morning upon handling<br><br>the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made<br><br>more water in her hold than common.  They supposed a sword-fish had<br><br>stabbed her, gentlemen.  But the captain, having some unusual reason<br><br>for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and<br><br>therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then<br><br>considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it<br><br>after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy<br><br>weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working<br><br>at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more<br><br>days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it<br><br>sensibly increased.  So much so, that now taking some alarm, the<br><br>captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the<br><br>islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.<br><br><br><br>"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance<br><br>favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the<br><br>way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically<br><br>relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep<br><br>the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her.  In<br><br>truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very<br><br>prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in<br><br>perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least<br><br>fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the<br><br>mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt,<br><br>a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.<br><br><br><br>"'Lakeman!--Buffalo!  Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?'<br><br>said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.<br><br><br><br>"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but--I crave your<br><br>courtesy--may be, you shall soon hear further of all that.  Now,<br><br>gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as<br><br>large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far<br><br>Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had<br><br>yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions<br><br>popularly connected with the open ocean.  For in their interflowing<br><br>aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,--Erie, and Ontario,<br><br>and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,--possess an ocean-like<br><br>expansiveness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits; with many of<br><br>its rimmed varieties of races and of climes.  They contain round<br><br>archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in<br><br>large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the<br><br>Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous<br><br>territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks;<br><br>here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like<br><br>craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings<br><br>of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild<br><br>barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry<br><br>wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered<br><br>forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in<br><br>Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of<br><br>prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar<br><br>Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as<br><br>well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant<br><br>ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech<br><br>canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as<br><br>any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out<br><br>of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a<br><br>midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.  Thus, gentlemen, though<br><br>an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;<br><br>as much of an audacious mariner as any.  And for Radney, though in<br><br>his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to<br><br>nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed<br><br>our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite<br><br>as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh<br><br>from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives.  Yet was this<br><br>Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a<br><br>mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible<br><br>firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition<br><br>which is the meanest slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had<br><br>long been retained harmless and docile.  At all events, he had proved<br><br>so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt--but,<br><br>gentlemen, you shall hear.<br><br><br><br>"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her<br><br>prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again<br><br>increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps<br><br>every day.  You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like<br><br>our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping<br><br>their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should<br><br>the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect,<br><br>the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again<br><br>remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.<br><br>Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,<br><br>gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at<br><br>their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable<br><br>length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if<br><br>any other reasonable retreat is afforded them.  It is only when a<br><br>leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters,<br><br>some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a<br><br>little anxious.<br><br><br><br>"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was<br><br>found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern<br><br>manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.<br><br>He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew,<br><br>and every way expanded to the breeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,<br><br>was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of<br><br>nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,<br><br>unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently<br><br>imagine, gentlemen.  Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about<br><br>the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only<br><br>on account of his being a part owner in her.  So when they were<br><br>working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small<br><br>gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet<br><br>continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any<br><br>mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps ran across<br><br>the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee<br><br>scupper-holes.<br><br><br><br>"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this<br><br>conventional world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person<br><br>placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very<br><br>significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway<br><br>against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and<br><br>bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize<br><br>that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.  Be<br><br>this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt<br><br>was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing<br><br>golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy's<br><br>snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him,<br><br>gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son<br><br>to Charlemagne's father.  But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule;<br><br>yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.  He did not love Steelkilt,<br><br>and Steelkilt knew it.<br><br><br><br>"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the<br><br>rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on<br><br>with his gay banterings.<br><br><br><br>"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,<br><br>one of ye, and let's have a taste.  By the Lord, it's worth bottling!<br><br>I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had<br><br>best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.  The fact is,<br><br>boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a<br><br>gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and<br><br>the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at<br><br>the bottom; making improvements, I suppose.  If old Rad were here<br><br>now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.  They're playing<br><br>the devil with his estate, I can tell him.  But he's a simple old<br><br>soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his<br><br>property is invested in looking-glasses.  I wonder if he'd give a<br><br>poor devil like me the model of his nose.'<br><br><br><br>"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,<br><br>pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk.  'Thunder away at<br><br>it!'<br><br><br><br>'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  'Lively, boys,<br><br>lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty<br><br>fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that<br><br>peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest<br><br>tension of life's utmost energies.<br><br><br><br>"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman<br><br>went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his<br><br>face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from<br><br>his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed<br><br>Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated<br><br>state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along<br><br>the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the<br><br>planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters<br><br>consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.<br><br><br><br>"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of<br><br>household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly<br><br>attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case<br><br>of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the<br><br>inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in<br><br>seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing<br><br>their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the<br><br>prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,<br><br>it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into<br><br>gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman<br><br>of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of<br><br>the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial<br><br>business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the<br><br>case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you<br><br>may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.<br><br><br><br>"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost<br><br>as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had<br><br>spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will<br><br>understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman<br><br>fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat<br><br>still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's<br><br>malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in<br><br>him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he<br><br>instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and<br><br>unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already<br><br>ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really<br><br>valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,<br><br>gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.<br><br><br><br>"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily<br><br>exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that<br><br>sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And<br><br>then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three<br><br>lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the<br><br>pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied<br><br>with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner<br><br>unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the<br><br>still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he<br><br>had snatched from a cask near by.<br><br><br><br>"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,<br><br>for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating<br><br>Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow<br><br>still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he<br><br>remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed<br><br>Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously<br><br>commanding him to do his bidding.<br><br><br><br>"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily<br><br>followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated<br><br>his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had<br><br>not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with<br><br>his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it<br><br>was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round<br><br>the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking<br><br>him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the<br><br>Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:<br><br><br><br>"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to<br><br>yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,<br><br>where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an<br><br>inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable<br><br>maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;<br><br>stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,<br><br>Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing<br><br>it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek<br><br>he (Steelkilt) would murder him.  But, gentlemen, the fool had been<br><br>branded for the slaughter by the gods.  Immediately the hammer<br><br>touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was<br><br>stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.<br><br><br><br>"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays<br><br>leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their<br><br>mastheads.  They were both Canallers.<br><br><br><br>"'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro.  'We have seen many whale-ships in our<br><br>harbours, but never heard of your Canallers.  Pardon: who and what are<br><br>they?'<br><br><br><br>"'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.<br><br>You must have heard of it.'<br><br><br><br>"'Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and<br><br>hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.'<br><br><br><br>"'Aye?  Well then, Don, refill my cup.  Your chicha's very fine; and<br><br>ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for<br><br>such information may throw side-light upon my story.'<br><br><br><br>"For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire<br><br>breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities<br><br>and most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps,<br><br>and affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by<br><br>billiard-room and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great<br><br>forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade;<br><br>by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery<br><br>of those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white<br><br>chapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one<br><br>continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life.<br><br>There's your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your pagans; where<br><br>you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung shadow,<br><br>and the snug patronising lee of churches.  For by some curious<br><br>fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that<br><br>they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen,<br><br>most abound in holiest vicinities.<br><br><br><br>"'Is that a friar passing?' said Don Pedro, looking downwards into<br><br>the crowded plazza, with humorous concern.<br><br><br><br>"'Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella's Inquisition wanes in<br><br>Lima,' laughed Don Sebastian.  'Proceed, Senor.'<br><br><br><br>"'A moment!  Pardon!' cried another of the company.  'In the name of<br><br>all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we<br><br>have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present<br><br>Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison.  Oh! do not bow<br><br>and look surprised; you know the proverb all along this<br><br>coast--"Corrupt as Lima."  It but bears out your saying, too;<br><br>churches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open--and<br><br>"Corrupt as Lima."  So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city<br><br>of the blessed evangelist, St. Mark!--St. Dominic, purge it!  Your<br><br>cup!  Thanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.'<br><br><br><br>"Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would<br><br>make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is<br><br>he.  Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed,<br><br>flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his<br><br>red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny<br><br>deck.  But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed.  The brigandish<br><br>guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and<br><br>gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features.  A terror to the<br><br>smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart<br><br>visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.  Once a vagabond<br><br>on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these<br><br>Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it<br><br>is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of<br><br>violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor<br><br>stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one.  In sum,<br><br>gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically<br><br>evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its<br><br>most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except<br><br>Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains.  Nor does<br><br>it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many<br><br>thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the<br><br>probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition<br><br>between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly<br><br>ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.<br><br><br><br>"'I see!  I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his<br><br>chicha upon his silvery ruffles.  'No need to travel!  The world's<br><br>one Lima.  I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the<br><br>generations were cold and holy as the hills.--But the story.'<br><br><br><br>"I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay.<br><br>Hardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior<br><br>mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck.  But<br><br>sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed<br><br>into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the<br><br>forecastle.  Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt,<br><br>and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm's way, the<br><br>valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon<br><br>his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him<br><br>along to the quarter-deck.  At intervals, he ran close up to the<br><br>revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it<br><br>with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment.  But<br><br>Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they<br><br>succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing<br><br>about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these<br><br>sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.<br><br><br><br>"'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing<br><br>them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.<br><br>'Come out of that, ye cut-throats!'<br><br><br><br>"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,<br><br>defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to<br><br>understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's) death would be the<br><br>signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.  Fearing in<br><br>his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little<br><br>desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to<br><br>their duty.<br><br><br><br>"'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their<br><br>ringleader.<br><br><br><br>"'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise;--to your duty!  Do you want<br><br>to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this?  Turn to!' and<br><br>he once more raised a pistol.<br><br><br><br>"'Sink the ship?' cried Steelkilt.  'Aye, let her sink.  Not a man of<br><br>us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us.<br><br>What say ye, men?' turning to his comrades.  A fierce cheer was their<br><br>response.<br><br><br><br>"The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his<br><br>eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:--'It's<br><br>not our fault; we didn't want it; I told him to take his hammer away;<br><br>it was boy's business; he might have known me before this; I told him<br><br>not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here<br><br>against his cursed jaw; ain't those mincing knives down in the<br><br>forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties.<br><br>Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don't be a fool;<br><br>forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we're<br><br>your men; but we won't be flogged.'<br><br><br><br>"'Turn to!  I make no promises, turn to, I say!'<br><br><br><br>"'Look ye, now,' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,<br><br>'there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped<br><br>for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our<br><br>discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don't want a row; it's<br><br>not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but<br><br>we won't be flogged.'<br><br><br><br>"'Turn to!' roared the Captain.<br><br><br><br>"Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:--'I tell you<br><br>what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a<br><br>shabby rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us;<br><br>but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's<br><br>turn.'<br><br><br><br>"'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there<br><br>till ye're sick of it.  Down ye go.'<br><br><br><br>"'Shall we?' cried the ringleader to his men.  Most of them were<br><br>against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded<br><br>him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears<br><br>into a cave.<br><br><br><br>"As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the<br><br>Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over<br><br>the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and<br><br>loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock<br><br>belonging to the companionway.<br><br><br><br>Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down<br><br>the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them--ten in<br><br>number--leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had<br><br>remained neutral.<br><br><br><br>"All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward<br><br>and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway;<br><br>at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after<br><br>breaking through the bulkhead below.  But the hours of darkness<br><br>passed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling<br><br>hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through<br><br>the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.<br><br><br><br>"At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,<br><br>summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused.  Water<br><br>was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit<br><br>were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and<br><br>pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck.  Twice every<br><br>day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a<br><br>confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary<br><br>summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the<br><br>forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.  The fetid closeness<br><br>of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of<br><br>ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at<br><br>discretion.  Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to<br><br>the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his<br><br>babbling and betake himself where he belonged.  On the fifth morning<br><br>three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the<br><br>desperate arms below that sought to restrain them.  Only three were<br><br>left.<br><br><br><br>"'Better turn to, now?' said the Captain with a heartless jeer.<br><br><br><br>"'Shut us up again, will ye!' cried Steelkilt.<br><br><br><br>"'Oh certainly,' the Captain, and the key clicked.<br><br><br><br>"It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of<br><br>seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that<br><br>had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place<br><br>as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt<br><br>proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with<br><br>him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the<br><br>garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic,<br><br>heavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the<br><br>bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation<br><br>possible, seize the ship.  For himself, he would do this, he said,<br><br>whether they joined him or not.  That was the last night he should<br><br>spend in that den.  But the scheme met with no opposition on the part<br><br>of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any<br><br>other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.  And what was<br><br>more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the<br><br>time to make the rush should come.  But to this their leader as<br><br>fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly<br><br>as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the<br><br>matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but<br><br>admit one man at a time.  And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these<br><br>miscreants must come out.<br><br><br><br>"Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own<br><br>separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same<br><br>piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in<br><br>order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to<br><br>surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such<br><br>conduct might merit.  But when Steelkilt made known his determination<br><br>still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle<br><br>chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together;<br><br>and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls<br><br>to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords,<br><br>and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at<br><br>midnight.<br><br><br><br>"Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he<br><br>and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle.<br><br>In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot,<br><br>the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his<br><br>perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man<br><br>who had been fully ripe for murder.  But all these were collared, and<br><br>dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were<br><br>seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and<br><br>there they hung till morning.  'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing<br><br>to and fro before them, 'the vultures would not touch ye, ye<br><br>villains!'<br><br><br><br>"At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had<br><br>rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the<br><br>former that he had a good mind to flog them all round--thought, upon<br><br>the whole, he would do so--he ought to--justice demanded it; but for<br><br>the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go<br><br>with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.<br><br><br><br>"'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,' turning to the three men in the<br><br>rigging--'for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;' and,<br><br>seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the<br><br>two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their<br><br>heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.<br><br><br><br>"'My wrist is sprained with ye!' he cried, at last; 'but there is<br><br>still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn't give<br><br>up.  Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say<br><br>for himself.'<br><br><br><br>"For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his<br><br>cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a<br><br>sort of hiss, 'What I say is this--and mind it well--if you flog me,<br><br>I murder you!'<br><br><br><br>"'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me'--and the Captain drew off<br><br>with the rope to strike.<br><br><br><br>"'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.<br><br><br><br>"'But I must,'--and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.<br><br><br><br>"Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the<br><br>Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the<br><br>deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his<br><br>rope, said, 'I won't do it--let him go--cut him down: d'ye hear?'<br><br><br><br>But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale<br><br>man, with a bandaged head, arrested them--Radney the chief mate.<br><br>Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning,<br><br>hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had<br><br>watched the whole scene.  Such was the state of his mouth, that he<br><br>could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being willing<br><br>and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the<br><br>rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.<br><br><br><br>"'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman.<br><br><br><br>"'So I am, but take that.'  The mate was in the very act of striking,<br><br>when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.  He paused: and then<br><br>pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt's threat,<br><br>whatever that might have been.  The three men were then cut down, all<br><br>hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the<br><br>iron pumps clanged as before.<br><br><br><br>"Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor<br><br>was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running<br><br>up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the<br><br>crew.  Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at<br><br>their own instance they were put down in the ship's run for<br><br>salvation.  Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest.  On<br><br>the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt's instigation, they<br><br>had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders<br><br>to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body.<br><br>But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all<br><br>agreed to another thing--namely, not to sing out for whales, in case<br><br>any should be discovered.  For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her<br><br>other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her<br><br>captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on<br><br>the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate<br><br>was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his<br><br>bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.<br><br><br><br>"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of<br><br>passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till<br><br>all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the<br><br>man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart.  He was in<br><br>Radney the chief mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to<br><br>run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the<br><br>rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain,<br><br>upon resuming the head of his watch at night.  Upon this, and one or<br><br>two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of<br><br>his revenge.<br><br><br><br>"During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the<br><br>bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of<br><br>the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side.<br><br>In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed.  There was a<br><br>considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between<br><br>this was the sea.  Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his<br><br>next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the<br><br>morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed.  At<br><br>his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very<br><br>carefully in his watches below.<br><br><br><br>"'What are you making there?' said a shipmate.<br><br><br><br>"'What do you think? what does it look like?'<br><br><br><br>"'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.'<br><br><br><br>'Yes, rather oddish,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length<br><br>before him; 'but I think it will answer.  Shipmate, I haven't enough<br><br>twine,--have you any?'<br><br><br><br>"But there was none in the forecastle.<br><br><br><br>"'Then I must get some from old Rad;' and he rose to go aft.<br><br><br><br>"'You don't mean to go a begging to HIM!' said a sailor.<br><br><br><br>"'Why not?  Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help<br><br>himself in the end, shipmate?' and going to the mate, he looked at<br><br>him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock.  It<br><br>was given him--neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the<br><br>next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the<br><br>pocket of the Lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat<br><br>into his hammock for a pillow.  Twenty-four hours after, his trick at<br><br>the silent helm--nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave<br><br>always ready dug to the seaman's hand--that fatal hour was then to<br><br>come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was<br><br>already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed<br><br>in.<br><br><br><br>"But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody<br><br>deed he had planned.  Yet complete revenge he had, and without being<br><br>the avenger.  For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to<br><br>step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he<br><br>would have done.<br><br><br><br>"It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the<br><br>second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid<br><br>Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted<br><br>out, 'There she rolls! there she rolls!'  Jesu, what a whale!  It was<br><br>Moby Dick.<br><br><br><br>"'Moby Dick!' cried Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic!  Sir sailor, but do<br><br>whales have christenings?  Whom call you Moby Dick?'<br><br><br><br>"'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster,<br><br>Don;--but that would be too long a story.'<br><br><br><br>"'How? how?' cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.<br><br><br><br>"'Nay, Dons, Dons--nay, nay!  I cannot rehearse that now.  Let me get<br><br>more into the air, Sirs.'<br><br><br><br>"'The chicha! the chicha!' cried Don Pedro; 'our vigorous friend looks<br><br>faint;--fill up his empty glass!'<br><br><br><br>"No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.--Now, gentlemen, so<br><br>suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the<br><br>ship--forgetful of the compact among the crew--in the excitement of<br><br>the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily<br><br>lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it<br><br>had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads.  All was<br><br>now a phrensy.  'The White Whale--the White Whale!' was the cry from<br><br>captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours,<br><br>were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the<br><br>dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of<br><br>the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun,<br><br>shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.<br><br>Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these<br><br>events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.<br><br>The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it<br><br>was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in<br><br>the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command.<br><br>Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate's got the start;<br><br>and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he<br><br>strained at his oar.  After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast,<br><br>and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow.  He was always a<br><br>furious man, it seems, in a boat.  And now his bandaged cry was, to<br><br>beach him on the whale's topmost back.  Nothing loath, his bowsman<br><br>hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two<br><br>whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a<br><br>sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate.  That<br><br>instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat righted,<br><br>and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into<br><br>the sea, on the other flank of the whale.  He struck out through the<br><br>spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly<br><br>seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.  But the whale<br><br>rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his<br><br>jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went<br><br>down.<br><br><br><br>"Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman had<br><br>slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly<br><br>looking on, he thought his own thoughts.  But a sudden, terrific,<br><br>downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line.<br><br>He cut it; and the whale was free.  But, at some distance, Moby Dick<br><br>rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught<br><br>in the teeth that had destroyed him.  All four boats gave chase<br><br>again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.<br><br><br><br>"In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port--a savage, solitary<br><br>place--where no civilized creature resided.  There, headed by the<br><br>Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately<br><br>deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a<br><br>large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some<br><br>other harbor.<br><br><br><br>"The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the captain<br><br>called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of<br><br>heaving down the ship to stop the leak.  But to such unresting<br><br>vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites<br><br>necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard<br><br>work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea,<br><br>they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put<br><br>off with them in so heavy a vessel.  After taking counsel with his<br><br>officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded<br><br>and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the<br><br>poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their<br><br>peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best<br><br>whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred<br><br>miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.<br><br><br><br>"On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which<br><br>seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.  He steered away from<br><br>it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of<br><br>Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water.<br><br>The captain presented a pistol.  With one foot on each prow of the<br><br>yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that<br><br>if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in<br><br>bubbles and foam.<br><br><br><br>"'What do you want of me?' cried the captain.<br><br><br><br>"'Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?' demanded<br><br>Steelkilt; 'no lies.'<br><br><br><br>"'I am bound to Tahiti for more men.'<br><br><br><br>"'Very good.  Let me board you a moment--I come in peace.'  With that<br><br>he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,<br><br>stood face to face with the captain.<br><br><br><br>"'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head.  Now, repeat after me.<br><br>As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder<br><br>island, and remain there six days.  If I do not, may lightning strike<br><br>me!'<br><br><br><br>"'A pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman.  'Adios, Senor!' and<br><br>leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.<br><br><br><br>"Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the<br><br>roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due<br><br>time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination.  There, luck<br><br>befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were<br><br>providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the<br><br>sailor headed.  They embarked; and so for ever got the start of<br><br>their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal<br><br>retribution.<br><br><br><br>"Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,<br><br>and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized<br><br>Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.  Chartering a small<br><br>native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all<br><br>right there, again resumed his cruisings.<br><br><br><br>"Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of<br><br>Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses<br><br>to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that<br><br>destroyed him.<br><br><br><br>"'Are you through?' said Don Sebastian, quietly.<br><br><br><br>"'I am, Don.'<br><br><br><br>"'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,<br><br>this your story is in substance really true?  It is so passing<br><br>wonderful!  Did you get it from an unquestionable source?  Bear with<br><br>me if I seem to press.'<br><br><br><br>"'Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don<br><br>Sebastian's suit,' cried the company, with exceeding interest.<br><br><br><br>"'Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,<br><br>gentlemen?'<br><br><br><br>"'Nay,' said Don Sebastian; 'but I know a worthy priest near by, who<br><br>will quickly procure one for me.  I go for it; but are you well<br><br>advised? this may grow too serious.'<br><br><br><br>"'Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?'<br><br><br><br>"'Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the<br><br>company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the<br><br>archiepiscopacy.  Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight.  I see<br><br>no need of this.'<br><br><br><br>"'Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg<br><br>that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized<br><br>Evangelists you can.'<br><br><br><br><br><br>'This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,' said Don<br><br>Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.<br><br><br><br>"'Let me remove my hat.  Now, venerable priest, further into the<br><br>light, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.<br><br><br><br>"'So help me Heaven, and on my honour the story I have told ye,<br><br>gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true.  I know it to<br><br>be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew;<br><br>I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.'"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 55<br><br><br><br>Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,<br><br>something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to<br><br>the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is<br><br>moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon<br><br>there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to<br><br>those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the<br><br>present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is<br><br>time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures<br><br>of the whale all wrong.<br><br><br><br>It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions<br><br>will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian<br><br>sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times<br><br>when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,<br><br>and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in<br><br>scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.<br><br>George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license<br><br>prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in<br><br>many scientific presentations of him.<br><br><br><br>Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting<br><br>to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of<br><br>Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost<br><br>endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and<br><br>pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages<br><br>before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in<br><br>some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there<br><br>shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate<br><br>department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the<br><br>form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though<br><br>this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the<br><br>tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.  It<br><br>looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms<br><br>of the true whale's majestic flukes.<br><br><br><br>But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian<br><br>painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the<br><br>antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing<br><br>Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale.  Where did Guido get the<br><br>model of such a strange creature as that?  Nor does Hogarth, in<br><br>painting the same scene in his own "Perseus Descending," make out one<br><br>whit better.  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster<br><br>undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has<br><br>a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into<br><br>which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate<br><br>leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the<br><br>Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as<br><br>depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.<br><br>What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale winding<br><br>like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped<br><br>and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and<br><br>new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,<br><br>imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though<br><br>universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this<br><br>book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended<br><br>when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old<br><br>Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the<br><br>Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a<br><br>comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a<br><br>species of the Leviathan.<br><br><br><br>In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you<br><br>will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all<br><br>manner of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and<br><br>Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.  In the<br><br>title-page of the original edition of the "Advancement of Learning"<br><br>you will find some curious whales.<br><br><br><br>But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at<br><br>those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific<br><br>delineations, by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of<br><br>voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book<br><br>of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled "A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in<br><br>the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master."<br><br>In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are<br><br>represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over<br><br>their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made<br><br>of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.<br><br><br><br>Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain<br><br>Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled "A Voyage round<br><br>Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the<br><br>Spermaceti Whale Fisheries."  In this book is an outline purporting<br><br>to be a "Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale<br><br>from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on<br><br>deck."  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for<br><br>the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let<br><br>me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the<br><br>accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye<br><br>of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.  Ah, my gallant<br><br>captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!<br><br><br><br>Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for<br><br>the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness<br><br>of mistake.  Look at that popular work "Goldsmith's Animated Nature."<br><br>In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an<br><br>alleged "whale" and a "narwhale."  I do not wish to seem inelegant,<br><br>but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as<br><br>for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in<br><br>this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine<br><br>upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.<br><br><br><br>Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great<br><br>naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are<br><br>several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.  All<br><br>these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or<br><br>Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a<br><br>long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have<br><br>its counterpart in nature.<br><br><br><br>But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was<br><br>reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous<br><br>Baron.  In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which<br><br>he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing<br><br>that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your<br><br>summary retreat from Nantucket.  In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm<br><br>Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.  Of course, he never had<br><br>the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he<br><br>derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his<br><br>scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his<br><br>authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort<br><br>of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and<br><br>saucers inform us.<br><br><br><br>As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the<br><br>shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them?  They are generally<br><br>Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;<br><br>breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full<br><br>of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue<br><br>paint.<br><br><br><br>But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very<br><br>surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings<br><br>have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as<br><br>correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would<br><br>correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride<br><br>of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their<br><br>full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated<br><br>himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and<br><br>significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and<br><br>afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched<br><br>line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally<br><br>impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to<br><br>preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of<br><br>the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking<br><br>whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of<br><br>one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is<br><br>then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that<br><br>his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.<br><br><br><br>But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded<br><br>whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at<br><br>all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,<br><br>that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.<br><br>Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the<br><br>library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a<br><br>burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other<br><br>leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be<br><br>inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.  In fact, as the<br><br>great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same<br><br>relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does<br><br>to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity<br><br>is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will<br><br>be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the<br><br>side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the<br><br>human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular<br><br>bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all<br><br>these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human<br><br>fingers in an artificial covering.  "However recklessly the whale may<br><br>sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day, "he can never be<br><br>truly said to handle us without mittens."<br><br><br><br>For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must<br><br>needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the<br><br>world which must remain unpainted to the last.  True, one portrait<br><br>may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with<br><br>any very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly<br><br>way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.  And<br><br>the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his<br><br>living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you<br><br>run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.<br><br>Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your<br><br>curiosity touching this Leviathan.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 56<br><br><br><br>Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of<br><br>Whaling Scenes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly<br><br>tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them<br><br>which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,<br><br>especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc.  But I<br><br>pass that matter by.<br><br><br><br>I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;<br><br>Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's.

Respectively, they<br><br>represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale.  In the first<br><br>engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,<br><br>just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and<br><br>bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the<br><br>stoven planks.  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is<br><br>drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine; and standing in that<br><br>prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an<br><br>oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,<br><br>and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.  The action of the<br><br>whole thing is wonderfully good and true.  The half-emptied line-tub<br><br>floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons<br><br>obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered<br><br>about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the<br><br>black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.<br><br>Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this<br><br>whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw<br><br>so good a one.<br><br><br><br>In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside<br><br>the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his<br><br>black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the<br><br>Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so<br><br>that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there<br><br>must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.  Sea fowls<br><br>are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and<br><br>maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent<br><br>back.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing<br><br>through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake,<br><br>and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught<br><br>nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.  Thus, the foreground is<br><br>all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is<br><br>the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of<br><br>the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered<br><br>fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole<br><br>inserted into his spout-hole.<br><br><br><br>Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not.  But my life for it<br><br>he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else<br><br>marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman.  The French are<br><br>the lads for painting action.  Go and gaze upon all the paintings of<br><br>Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and<br><br>breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at<br><br>Versailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the<br><br>consecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash<br><br>of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors<br><br>dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs?  Not wholly unworthy of a<br><br>place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.<br><br><br><br>The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of<br><br>things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and<br><br>engravings they have of their whaling scenes.  With not one tenth of<br><br>England's experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of<br><br>that of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations<br><br>with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real<br><br>spirit of the whale hunt.  For the most part, the English and<br><br>American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the<br><br>mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the<br><br>whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is<br><br>about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid.  Even<br><br>Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff<br><br>full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate<br><br>miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of<br><br>classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels;<br><br>and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the<br><br>inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified<br><br>Arctic snow crystals.  I mean no disparagement to the excellent<br><br>voyager (I honour him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it<br><br>was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a<br><br>sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.<br><br><br><br>In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two<br><br>other French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes<br><br>himself "H.  Durand."  One of them, though not precisely adapted to<br><br>our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts.<br><br>It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French<br><br>whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on<br><br>board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the<br><br>palms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless<br><br>air.  The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its<br><br>presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of<br><br>oriental repose.  The other engraving is quite a different affair:<br><br>the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the<br><br>Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the<br><br>act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a<br><br>boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about<br><br>giving chase to whales in the distance.  The harpoons and lances lie<br><br>levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its<br><br>hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands<br><br>half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse.  From the ship,<br><br>the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the<br><br>smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud,<br><br>rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the<br><br>activity of the excited seamen.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 57<br><br><br><br>Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in<br><br>Mountains; in Stars.<br><br><br><br><br><br>On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen<br><br>a crippled beggar (or KEDGER, as the sailors say) holding a painted<br><br>board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his<br><br>leg.  There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats<br><br>(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity)<br><br>is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale.  Any time these<br><br>ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and<br><br>exhibited that stump to an incredulous world.  But the time of his<br><br>justification has now come.

Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle<br><br>overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales<br><br>against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split<br><br>wrecks of ships.

And still, at wide intervals in the silvery<br><br>night, the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.<br><br><br><br>But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost<br><br>preternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any<br><br>stagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed<br><br>a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the<br><br>slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on; in this<br><br>profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by<br><br>Daggoo from the main-mast-head.<br><br><br><br>In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher<br><br>and higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed<br><br>before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills.  Thus<br><br>glistening for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank.  Then once<br><br>more arose, and silently gleamed.  It seemed not a whale; and yet is<br><br>this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo.  Again the phantom went down, but on<br><br>re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every<br><br>man from his nod, the negro yelled out--"There! there again! there<br><br>she breaches! right ahead!  The White Whale, the White Whale!"<br><br><br><br>Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time<br><br>the bees rush to the boughs.  Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab<br><br>stood on the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in<br><br>readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance<br><br>in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm<br><br>of Daggoo.<br><br><br><br>Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had<br><br>gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect<br><br>the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the<br><br>particular whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his<br><br>eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner<br><br>did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick<br><br>intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.<br><br><br><br>The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab's in advance, and all<br><br>swiftly pulling towards their prey.  Soon it went down, and while,<br><br>with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the<br><br>same spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose.  Almost forgetting<br><br>for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most<br><br>wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to<br><br>mankind.  A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a<br><br>glancing cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long<br><br>arms radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest<br><br>of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within<br><br>reach.  No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable<br><br>token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the<br><br>billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.<br><br><br><br>As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck<br><br>still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild<br><br>voice exclaimed--"Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him,<br><br>than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!"<br><br><br><br>"What was it, Sir?" said Flask.<br><br><br><br>"The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,<br><br>and returned to their ports to tell of it."<br><br><br><br>But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the<br><br>vessel; the rest as silently following.<br><br><br><br>Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected<br><br>with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it<br><br>being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it<br><br>with portentousness.  So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all<br><br>of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet<br><br>very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its<br><br>true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to<br><br>the sperm whale his only food.  For though other species of whales<br><br>find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of<br><br>feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones<br><br>below the surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell<br><br>of what, precisely, that food consists.  At times, when closely<br><br>pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms<br><br>of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty<br><br>feet in length.  They fancy that the monster to which these arms<br><br>belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that<br><br>the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in<br><br>order to attack and tear it.<br><br><br><br>There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop<br><br>Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid.  The manner in<br><br>which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking,<br><br>with some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two<br><br>correspond.  But much abatement is necessary with respect to the<br><br>incredible bulk he assigns it.<br><br><br><br>By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious<br><br>creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of<br><br>cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would<br><br>seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 60<br><br><br><br>The Line.<br><br><br><br><br><br>With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well<br><br>as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere<br><br>presented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible<br><br>whale-line.<br><br><br><br>The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp,<br><br>slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of<br><br>ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp<br><br>more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more<br><br>convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the<br><br>ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close<br><br>coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are<br><br>beginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope's<br><br>durability or strength, however much it may give it compactness and<br><br>gloss.<br><br><br><br>Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost<br><br>entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though<br><br>not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and<br><br>elastic; and I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things),<br><br>is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp.  Hemp is a<br><br>dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a<br><br>golden-haired Circassian to behold.<br><br><br><br>The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness.  At first<br><br>sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is.  By<br><br>experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one<br><br>hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain<br><br>nearly equal to three tons.  In length, the common sperm whale-line<br><br>measures something over two hundred fathoms.  Towards the stern of<br><br>the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the<br><br>worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,<br><br>cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of<br><br>concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or<br><br>minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese.  As the least<br><br>tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take<br><br>somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is<br><br>used in stowing the line in its tub.  Some harpooneers will consume<br><br>almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high<br><br>aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub,<br><br>so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and<br><br>twists.<br><br><br><br>In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line<br><br>being continuously coiled in both tubs.  There is some advantage in<br><br>this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily<br><br>into the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American<br><br>tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes<br><br>a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch<br><br>in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice,<br><br>which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very<br><br>much of a concentrated one.  When the painted canvas cover is clapped<br><br>on the American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off<br><br>with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.<br><br><br><br>Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an<br><br>eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the<br><br>tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.<br><br>This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts.<br><br>First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional<br><br>line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound<br><br>so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally<br><br>attached to the harpoon.  In these instances, the whale of course is<br><br>shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the<br><br>other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its<br><br>consort.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common<br><br>safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached<br><br>to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end<br><br>almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not<br><br>stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down<br><br>after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no<br><br>town-crier would ever find her again.<br><br><br><br>Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is<br><br>taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is<br><br>again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting<br><br>crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs<br><br>against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as<br><br>they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks<br><br>or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden<br><br>pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping<br><br>out.  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and<br><br>is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms<br><br>(called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues<br><br>its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then<br><br>attached to the short-warp--the rope which is immediately connected<br><br>with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes<br><br>through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.<br><br><br><br>Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,<br><br>twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.  All the<br><br>oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the<br><br>timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the<br><br>deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.  Nor can any son<br><br>of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen<br><br>intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him<br><br>that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these<br><br>horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot<br><br>be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in<br><br>his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.  Yet habit--strange<br><br>thing! what cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry<br><br>mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over<br><br>your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of<br><br>the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six<br><br>burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew<br><br>pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you<br><br>may say.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for<br><br>those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually<br><br>chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by<br><br>the line, and lost.  For, when the line is darting out, to be seated<br><br>then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold<br><br>whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and<br><br>shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.  It is worse; for you cannot sit<br><br>motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking<br><br>like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the<br><br>slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and<br><br>simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a<br><br>Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could<br><br>never pierce you out.<br><br><br><br>Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and<br><br>prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;<br><br>for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm;<br><br>and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the<br><br>fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose<br><br>of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before<br><br>being brought into actual play--this is a thing which carries more of<br><br>true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair.  But why<br><br>say more?  All men live enveloped in whale-lines.  All are born with<br><br>halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift,<br><br>sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle,<br><br>ever-present perils of life.  And if you be a philosopher, though<br><br>seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more<br><br>of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker,<br><br>and not a harpoon, by your side.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 61<br><br><br><br>Stubb Kills a Whale.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents,<br><br>to Queequeg it was quite a different object.<br><br><br><br>"When you see him 'quid," said the savage, honing his harpoon in the<br><br>bow of his hoisted boat, "then you quick see him 'parm whale."<br><br><br><br>The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing<br><br>special to engage them, the Pequod's crew could hardly resist the<br><br>spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea.  For this part of the<br><br>Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen<br><br>call a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of<br><br>porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of<br><br>more stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the<br><br>in-shore ground off Peru.<br><br><br><br>It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders<br><br>leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed<br><br>in what seemed an enchanted air.  No resolution could withstand it;<br><br>in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went<br><br>out of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum<br><br>will, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.<br><br><br><br>Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the<br><br>seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy.  So<br><br>that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for<br><br>every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the<br><br>slumbering helmsman.  The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests;<br><br>and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the<br><br>sun over all.<br><br><br><br>Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices<br><br>my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency<br><br>preserved me; with a shock I came back to life.  And lo! close under<br><br>our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in<br><br>the water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy<br><br>back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun's rays like a<br><br>mirror.  But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and<br><br>anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet, the whale looked like a<br><br>portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon.  But that pipe,<br><br>poor whale, was thy last.  As if struck by some enchanter's wand, the<br><br>sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into<br><br>wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the<br><br>vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth<br><br>the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted<br><br>the sparkling brine into the air.<br><br><br><br>"Clear away the boats!  Luff!" cried Ahab.  And obeying his own<br><br>order, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the<br><br>spokes.<br><br><br><br>The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and<br><br>ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the<br><br>leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few<br><br>ripples as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be<br><br>alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man<br><br>must speak but in whispers.  So seated like Ontario Indians on the<br><br>gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the<br><br>calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set.  Presently, as<br><br>we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail<br><br>forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower<br><br>swallowed up.<br><br><br><br>"There go flukes!" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed<br><br>by Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a<br><br>respite was granted.  After the full interval of his sounding had<br><br>elapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the<br><br>smoker's boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb<br><br>counted upon the honour of the capture.  It was obvious, now, that the<br><br>whale had at length become aware of his pursuers.  All silence of<br><br>cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.  Paddles were dropped,<br><br>and oars came loudly into play.  And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb<br><br>cheered on his crew to the assault.<br><br><br><br>Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish.  All alive to his<br><br>jeopardy, he was going "head out"; that part obliquely projecting<br><br>from the mad yeast which he brewed.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance<br><br>the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists.<br><br>Though apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant<br><br>part about him.  So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and<br><br>invariably does so when going at his utmost speed.  Besides, such is<br><br>the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the<br><br>tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely<br><br>elevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from<br><br>a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York<br><br>pilot-boat.<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Start her, start her, my men!  Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty<br><br>of time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all,"<br><br>cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke.  "Start her, now;<br><br>give 'em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego.  Start her, Tash, my<br><br>boy--start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--cucumbers is the<br><br>word--easy, easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils,<br><br>and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,<br><br>boys--that's all.  Start her!"<br><br><br><br>"Woo-hoo!  Wa-hee!" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some<br><br>old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat<br><br>involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke<br><br>which the eager Indian gave.<br><br><br><br>But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild.<br><br>"Kee-hee!  Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards<br><br>on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.<br><br><br><br>"Ka-la!  Koo-loo!" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a<br><br>mouthful of Grenadier's steak.  And thus with oars and yells the<br><br>keels cut the sea.  Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the<br><br>van, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the<br><br>smoke from his mouth.  Like desperadoes they tugged and they<br><br>strained, till the welcome cry was heard--"Stand up, Tashtego!--give<br><br>it to him!"  The harpoon was hurled.  "Stern all!"  The oarsmen<br><br>backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along<br><br>every one of their wrists.  It was the magical line.  An instant<br><br>before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round<br><br>the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a<br><br>hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes<br><br>from his pipe.  As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so<br><br>also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through<br><br>and through both of Stubb's hands, from which the hand-cloths, or<br><br>squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had<br><br>accidentally dropped.  It was like holding an enemy's sharp two-edged<br><br>sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it<br><br>out of your clutch.<br><br><br><br>"Wet the line! wet the line!" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him<br><br>seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into<br><br>it.*  More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.<br><br>The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.<br><br>Stubb and Tashtego here changed places--stem for stern--a staggering<br><br>business truly in that rocking commotion.<br><br><br><br><br><br>*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be<br><br>stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the<br><br>running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or<br><br>bailer, is set apart for that purpose.  Your hat, however, is the<br><br>most convenient.<br><br><br><br><br><br>From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part<br><br>of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you<br><br>would have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water,<br><br>the other the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing<br><br>elements at once.  A continual cascade played at the bows; a<br><br>ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion<br><br>from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking<br><br>craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea.  Thus they<br><br>rushed; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent<br><br>being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the<br><br>steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring down his<br><br>centre of gravity.  Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as<br><br>they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened<br><br>his flight.<br><br><br><br>"Haul in--haul in!" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round<br><br>towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while<br><br>yet the boat was being towed on.  Soon ranging up by his flank,<br><br>Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart<br><br>after dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat<br><br>alternately sterning out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow,<br><br>and then ranging up for another fling.<br><br><br><br>The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks<br><br>down a hill.  His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood,<br><br>which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake.  The<br><br>slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back<br><br>its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other<br><br>like red men.  And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was<br><br>agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff<br><br>after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart,<br><br>hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb<br><br>straightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the<br><br>gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.<br><br><br><br>"Pull up--pull up!" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale<br><br>relaxed in his wrath.  "Pull up!--close to!" and the boat ranged<br><br>along the fish's flank.  When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly<br><br>churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there,<br><br>carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel<br><br>after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which<br><br>he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.  But that gold<br><br>watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish.  And now it is<br><br>struck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing<br><br>called his "flurry," the monster horribly wallowed in his blood,<br><br>overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the<br><br>imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to<br><br>struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the<br><br>day.<br><br><br><br>And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into<br><br>view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and<br><br>contracting his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized<br><br>respirations.  At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it<br><br>had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and<br><br>falling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into<br><br>the sea.  His heart had burst!<br><br><br><br>"He's dead, Mr. Stubb," said Daggoo.<br><br><br><br>"Yes; both pipes smoked out!" and withdrawing his own from his mouth,<br><br>Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment,<br><br>stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 62<br><br><br><br>The Dart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.<br><br><br><br>According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat<br><br>pushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as<br><br>temporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the<br><br>foremost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar.  Now it needs a<br><br>strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for<br><br>often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be<br><br>flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet.  But however<br><br>prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to<br><br>pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to<br><br>set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by<br><br>incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;<br><br>and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass, while<br><br>all the other muscles are strained and half started--what that is<br><br>none know but those who have tried it.  For one, I cannot bawl very<br><br>heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time.  In this<br><br>straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at<br><br>once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--"Stand up, and<br><br>give it to him!"  He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round<br><br>on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with<br><br>what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into<br><br>the whale.  No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body,<br><br>that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful;<br><br>no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and<br><br>disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their<br><br>blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are<br><br>absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship<br><br>owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer<br><br>that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how<br><br>can you expect to find it there when most wanted!<br><br><br><br>Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical<br><br>instant, that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and<br><br>harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent<br><br>jeopardy of themselves and every one else.  It is then they change<br><br>places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft,<br><br>takes his proper station in the bows of the boat.<br><br><br><br>Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both<br><br>foolish and unnecessary.  The headsman should stay in the bows from<br><br>first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no<br><br>rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances<br><br>obvious to any fisherman.  I know that this would sometimes involve a<br><br>slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various<br><br>whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast<br><br>majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so<br><br>much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the<br><br>harpooneer that has caused them.<br><br><br><br>To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of<br><br>this world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not<br><br>from out of toil.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 63<br><br><br><br>The Crotch.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.  So, in<br><br>productive subjects, grow the chapters.<br><br><br><br>The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent<br><br>mention.  It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in<br><br>length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale<br><br>near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden<br><br>extremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly<br><br>projects from the prow.  Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to<br><br>its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a<br><br>backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.  It is customary to have<br><br>two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first<br><br>and second irons.<br><br><br><br>But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with<br><br>the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one<br><br>instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the<br><br>coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold.<br><br>It is a doubling of the chances.  But it very often happens that<br><br>owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale<br><br>upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the<br><br>harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the<br><br>second iron into him.  Nevertheless, as the second iron is already<br><br>connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon<br><br>must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,<br><br>somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve<br><br>all hands.  Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases;<br><br>the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making<br><br>this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.  But this<br><br>critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal<br><br>casualties.<br><br><br><br>Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown<br><br>overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,<br><br>skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the<br><br>lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all<br><br>directions.  Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until<br><br>the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.<br><br><br><br>Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging<br><br>one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these<br><br>qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of<br><br>such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be<br><br>simultaneously dangling about him.  For, of course, each boat is<br><br>supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the<br><br>first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.  All these<br><br>particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to<br><br>elucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in<br><br>scenes hereafter to be painted.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 64<br><br><br><br>Stubb's Supper.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship.  It was a<br><br>calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow<br><br>business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen<br><br>men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and<br><br>fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish<br><br>corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at<br><br>long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the<br><br>enormousness of the mass we moved.  For, upon the great canal of<br><br>Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on<br><br>the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile<br><br>an hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if<br><br>laden with pig-lead in bulk.<br><br><br><br>Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's<br><br>main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab<br><br>dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks.  Vacantly<br><br>eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for<br><br>securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,<br><br>went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until<br><br>morning.<br><br><br><br>Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had<br><br>evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the<br><br>creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or<br><br>despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body<br><br>reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a<br><br>thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not<br><br>one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.  Very soon you would<br><br>have thought from the sound on the Pequod's decks, that all hands<br><br>were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being<br><br>dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.<br><br>But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is<br><br>to be moored.  Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the<br><br>bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's<br><br>and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars<br><br>and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale, seemed yoked together<br><br>like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains<br><br>standing.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*A little item may as well be related here.  The strongest and most<br><br>reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored<br><br>alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density<br><br>that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the<br><br>side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low<br><br>beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from<br><br>the boat, in order to put the chain round it.  But this difficulty is<br><br>ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden<br><br>float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other<br><br>end is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is<br><br>made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having<br><br>girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and<br><br>being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the<br><br>smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad<br><br>flukes or lobes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be<br><br>known on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest,<br><br>betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement.  Such an<br><br>unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official<br><br>superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of<br><br>affairs.  One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb,<br><br>was soon made strangely manifest.  Stubb was a high liver; he was<br><br>somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his<br><br>palate.<br><br><br><br>"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep!  You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and<br><br>cut me one from his small!"<br><br><br><br>Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a<br><br>general thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the<br><br>enemy defray the current expenses of the war (at least before<br><br>realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet now and then you find some<br><br>of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular<br><br>part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering<br><br>extremity of the body.<br><br><br><br>About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two<br><br>lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti<br><br>supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.  Nor<br><br>was Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night.  Mingling<br><br>their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of<br><br>sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its<br><br>fatness.  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled<br><br>by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few<br><br>inches of the sleepers' hearts.  Peering over the side you could just<br><br>see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black<br><br>waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge<br><br>globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.  This<br><br>particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous.  How at such<br><br>an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such<br><br>symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all<br><br>things.  The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened<br><br>to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.<br><br><br><br>Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight,<br><br>sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like<br><br>hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to<br><br>bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while<br><br>the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving<br><br>each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled,<br><br>the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely<br><br>carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you<br><br>to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much<br><br>the same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough<br><br>for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders<br><br>of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting<br><br>alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or<br><br>a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like<br><br>instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and<br><br>occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most<br><br>hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when<br><br>you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more<br><br>jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a<br><br>whaleship at sea.  If you have never seen that sight, then suspend<br><br>your decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the<br><br>expediency of conciliating the devil.<br><br><br><br>But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was<br><br>going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of<br><br>his own epicurean lips.<br><br><br><br>"Cook, cook!--where's that old Fleece?" he cried at length, widening<br><br>his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his<br><br>supper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if<br><br>stabbing with his lance; "cook, you cook!--sail this way, cook!"<br><br><br><br>The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously<br><br>roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came<br><br>shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was<br><br>something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well<br><br>scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him,<br><br>came shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs,<br><br>which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops;<br><br>this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of<br><br>command, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb's<br><br>sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and resting on<br><br>his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further over, at<br><br>the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his best<br><br>ear into play.<br><br><br><br>"Cook," said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his<br><br>mouth, "don't you think this steak is rather overdone?  You've been<br><br>beating this steak too much, cook; it's too tender.  Don't I always<br><br>say that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough?  There are those<br><br>sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and<br><br>rare?  What a shindy they are kicking up!  Cook, go and talk to 'em;<br><br>tell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in<br><br>moderation, but they must keep quiet.  Blast me, if I can hear my own<br><br>voice.  Away, cook, and deliver my message.  Here, take this<br><br>lantern," snatching one from his sideboard; "now then, go and preach<br><br>to 'em!"<br><br><br><br>Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the<br><br>deck to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low<br><br>over the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the<br><br>other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the<br><br>side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb,<br><br>softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.<br><br><br><br>"Fellow-critters: I'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam<br><br>noise dare.  You hear?  Stop dat dam smackin' ob de lips!  Massa<br><br>Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but<br><br>by Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!"<br><br><br><br>"Cook," here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden<br><br>slap on the shoulder,--"Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn't swear<br><br>that way when you're preaching.  That's no way to convert sinners,<br><br>cook!"<br><br><br><br>"Who dat?  Den preach to him yourself," sullenly turning to go.<br><br><br><br>"No, cook; go on, go on."<br><br><br><br>"Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:"-<br><br><br><br>"Right!" exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, "coax 'em to it; try that,"<br><br>and Fleece continued.<br><br><br><br>"Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,<br><br>fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness--'top dat dam slappin' ob de<br><br>tail!  How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin'<br><br>and bitin' dare?"<br><br><br><br>"Cook," cried Stubb, collaring him, "I won't have that swearing.<br><br>Talk to 'em gentlemanly."<br><br><br><br>Once more the sermon proceeded.<br><br><br><br>"Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don't blame ye so much for;<br><br>dat is natur, and can't be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur,<br><br>dat is de pint.  You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in<br><br>you, why den you be angel; for all angel is not'ing more dan de shark<br><br>well goberned.

Kick up de damndest row as ever you can;<br><br>fill your dam bellies 'till dey bust--and den die."<br><br><br><br>"Now, cook," said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; "stand<br><br>just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay<br><br>particular attention."<br><br><br><br>"All 'dention," said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in<br><br>the desired position.<br><br><br><br>"Well," said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; "I shall now go<br><br>back to the subject of this steak.  In the first place, how old are<br><br>you, cook?"<br><br><br><br>"What dat do wid de 'teak," said the old black, testily.<br><br><br><br>"Silence!  How old are you, cook?"<br><br><br><br>"'Bout ninety, dey say," he gloomily muttered.<br><br><br><br>"And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,<br><br>and don't know yet how to cook a whale-steak?" rapidly bolting<br><br>another mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a<br><br>continuation of the question.  "Where were you born, cook?"<br><br><br><br>"'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke."<br><br><br><br>"Born in a ferry-boat!  That's queer, too.  But I want to know what<br><br>country you were born in, cook!"<br><br><br><br>"Didn't I say de Roanoke country?" he cried sharply.<br><br><br><br>"No, you didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook.<br><br>You must go home and be born over again; you don't know how to cook a<br><br>whale-steak yet."<br><br><br><br>"Bress my soul, if I cook noder one," he growled, angrily, turning<br><br>round to depart.<br><br><br><br>"Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit<br><br>of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it<br><br>should be?  Take it, I say"--holding the tongs towards him--"take it,<br><br>and taste it."<br><br><br><br>Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old<br><br>negro muttered, "Best cooked 'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy."<br><br><br><br>"Cook," said Stubb, squaring himself once more; "do you belong to the<br><br>church?"<br><br><br><br>"Passed one once in Cape-Down," said the old man sullenly.<br><br><br><br>"And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,<br><br>where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as<br><br>his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook!  And yet you come here,<br><br>and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?" said Stubb.<br><br>"Where do you expect to go to, cook?"<br><br><br><br>"Go to bed berry soon," he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.<br><br><br><br>"Avast! heave to!  I mean when you die, cook.  It's an awful<br><br>question.  Now what's your answer?"<br><br><br><br>"When dis old brack man dies," said the negro slowly, changing his<br><br>whole air and demeanor, "he hisself won't go nowhere; but some<br><br>bressed angel will come and fetch him."<br><br><br><br>"Fetch him?  How?  In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah?  And<br><br>fetch him where?"<br><br><br><br>"Up dere," said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and<br><br>keeping it there very solemnly.<br><br><br><br>"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when<br><br>you are dead?  But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it<br><br>gets?  Main-top, eh?"<br><br><br><br>"Didn't say dat t'all," said Fleece, again in the sulks.<br><br><br><br>"You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see where<br><br>your tongs are pointing.  But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven<br><br>by crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you<br><br>don't get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging.<br><br>It's a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go.  But<br><br>none of us are in heaven yet.  Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my<br><br>orders.  Do ye hear?

Aloft! aloft!--that's<br><br>it--now you have it.  Hold it there now, and pay attention."<br><br><br><br>"All 'dention," said the old black, with both hands placed as<br><br>desired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears<br><br>in front at one and the same time.<br><br><br><br>"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,<br><br>that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,<br><br>don't you?

Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of<br><br>the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce<br><br>to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a<br><br>species of whale.  Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine<br><br>eating.  The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard<br><br>balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for<br><br>turtle-balls or veal balls.  The old monks of Dunfermline were very<br><br>fond of them.  They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.<br><br><br><br>The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all<br><br>hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but<br><br>when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet<br><br>long, it takes away your appetite.  Only the most unprejudiced of men<br><br>like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are<br><br>not so fastidious.  We all know how they live upon whales, and have<br><br>rare old vintages of prime old train oil.  Zogranda, one of their<br><br>most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as<br><br>being exceedingly juicy and nourishing.  And this reminds me that<br><br>certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland<br><br>by a whaling vessel--that these men actually lived for several months<br><br>on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after<br><br>trying out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are<br><br>called "fritters"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown<br><br>and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives'<br><br>dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.  They have such an eatable look<br><br>that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.<br><br><br><br>But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his<br><br>exceeding richness.  He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to<br><br>be delicately good.  Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating<br><br>as the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a<br><br>solid pyramid of fat.  But the spermaceti itself, how bland and<br><br>creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a<br><br>cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply<br><br>a substitute for butter.  Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method<br><br>of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it.<br><br>In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the<br><br>seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them<br><br>fry there awhile.

The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the<br><br>two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two<br><br>large puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a<br><br>most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head,<br><br>which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that<br><br>some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon<br><br>calves' brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own,<br><br>so as to be able to tell a calf's head from their own heads; which,<br><br>indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.  And that is the reason why<br><br>a young buck with an intelligent looking calf's head before him, is<br><br>somehow one of the saddest sights you can see.  The head looks a sort<br><br>of reproachfully at him, with an "Et tu Brute!" expression.<br><br><br><br>It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively<br><br>unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with<br><br>abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the<br><br>consideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly<br><br>murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.  But no<br><br>doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a<br><br>murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by<br><br>oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it if<br><br>any murderer does.  Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see<br><br>the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead<br><br>quadrupeds.  Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal's<br><br>jaw?  Cannibals? who is not a cannibal?  I tell you it will be more<br><br>tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his<br><br>cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that<br><br>provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee,<br><br>civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground<br><br>and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.<br><br><br><br>But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is<br><br>adding insult to injury, is it?  Look at your knife-handle, there, my<br><br>civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what<br><br>is that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother of the<br><br>very ox you are eating?  And what do you pick your teeth with, after<br><br>devouring that fat goose?  With a feather of the same fowl.  And with<br><br>what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of<br><br>Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars?  It is only within<br><br>the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to<br><br>patronise nothing but steel pens.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 66<br><br><br><br>The Shark Massacre.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and<br><br>weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a<br><br>general thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business<br><br>of cutting him in.  For that business is an exceedingly laborious<br><br>one; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about<br><br>it.  Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the<br><br>helm a'lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till<br><br>daylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches<br><br>shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the<br><br>crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.<br><br><br><br>But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan<br><br>will not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks<br><br>gather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours,<br><br>say, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by<br><br>morning.  In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish<br><br>do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times<br><br>considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp<br><br>whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some<br><br>instances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity.<br><br>But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod's sharks;<br><br>though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have<br><br>looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the whole<br><br>round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.<br><br><br><br>Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper<br><br>was concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle<br><br>seaman came on deck, no small excitement was created among the<br><br>sharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side,<br><br>and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light<br><br>over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long<br><br>whaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,* by<br><br>striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only<br><br>vital part.  But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling<br><br>hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought<br><br>about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.  They<br><br>viciously snapped, not only at each other's disembowelments, but like<br><br>flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails<br><br>seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be<br><br>oppositely voided by the gaping wound.  Nor was this all.  It was<br><br>unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures.  A<br><br>sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very<br><br>joints and bones, after what might be called the individual life had<br><br>departed.  Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one<br><br>of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off, when he tried<br><br>to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.<br><br><br><br><br><br>*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best<br><br>steel; is about the bigness of a man's spread hand; and in general<br><br>shape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named;<br><br>only its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably<br><br>narrower than the lower.  This weapon is always kept as sharp as<br><br>possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a<br><br>razor.  In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long,<br><br>is inserted for a handle.<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Queequeg no care what god made him shark," said the savage,<br><br>agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; "wedder Fejee god or<br><br>Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 67<br><br><br><br>Cutting In.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed!  Ex officio<br><br>professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen.  The ivory Pequod<br><br>was turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher.  You<br><br>would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the<br><br>sea gods.<br><br><br><br>In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other<br><br>ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted<br><br>green, and which no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of<br><br>grapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower<br><br>mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck.  The end<br><br>of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then<br><br>conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles<br><br>was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook,<br><br>weighing some one hundred pounds, was attached.  And now suspended in<br><br>stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their<br><br>long spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of<br><br>the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.  This done, a<br><br>broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted,<br><br>and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence<br><br>heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass.  When instantly, the<br><br>entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like<br><br>the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles,<br><br>quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky.  More and more<br><br>she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the<br><br>windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at<br><br>last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship<br><br>rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle<br><br>rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of<br><br>the first strip of blubber.  Now as the blubber envelopes the whale<br><br>precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the<br><br>body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it.<br><br>For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps<br><br>the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in<br><br>one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the "scarf,"<br><br>simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates;<br><br>and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very<br><br>act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft<br><br>till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then<br><br>cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping<br><br>mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one<br><br>present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may<br><br>box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.<br><br><br><br>One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen<br><br>weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he<br><br>dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the<br><br>swaying mass.  Into this hole, the end of the second alternating<br><br>great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber,<br><br>in order to prepare for what follows.  Whereupon, this accomplished<br><br>swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a<br><br>scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate,<br><br>lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the<br><br>short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a<br><br>blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.  The<br><br>heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is<br><br>peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is<br><br>slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main<br><br>hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the<br><br>blubber-room.  Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep<br><br>coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass<br><br>of plaited serpents.  And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles<br><br>hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass<br><br>heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the<br><br>mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing<br><br>occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 68<br><br><br><br>The Blanket.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin<br><br>of the whale.  I have had controversies about it with experienced<br><br>whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore.  My original opinion<br><br>remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.<br><br><br><br>The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale?  Already<br><br>you know what his blubber is.  That blubber is something of the<br><br>consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic<br><br>and compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen<br><br>inches in thickness.<br><br><br><br>Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any<br><br>creature's skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness,<br><br>yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a<br><br>presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping<br><br>layer from the whale's body but that same blubber; and the outermost<br><br>enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be<br><br>but the skin?  True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you<br><br>may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent<br><br>substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only<br><br>it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to<br><br>being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes<br><br>rather hard and brittle.  I have several such dried bits, which I use<br><br>for marks in my whale-books.  It is transparent, as I said before;<br><br>and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself<br><br>with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence.  At any rate, it is<br><br>pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you<br><br>may say.  But what I am driving at here is this.  That same<br><br>infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the<br><br>entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin<br><br>of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were<br><br>simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous<br><br>whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.<br><br>But no more of this.<br><br><br><br>Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this<br><br>skin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk<br><br>of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in<br><br>quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only<br><br>three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea<br><br>may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere<br><br>part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.<br><br>Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net<br><br>weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale's skin.<br><br><br><br>In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least<br><br>among the many marvels he presents.  Almost invariably it is all over<br><br>obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in<br><br>thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line<br><br>engravings.  But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the<br><br>isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it,<br><br>as if they were engraved upon the body itself.  Nor is this all.  In<br><br>some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as<br><br>in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other<br><br>delineations.  These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those<br><br>mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that<br><br>is the proper word to use in the present connexion.  By my retentive<br><br>memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was<br><br>much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters<br><br>chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the<br><br>Upper Mississippi.  Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked<br><br>whale remains undecipherable.  This allusion to the Indian rocks<br><br>reminds me of another thing.  Besides all the other phenomena which<br><br>the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the<br><br>back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the<br><br>regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,<br><br>altogether of an irregular, random aspect.  I should say that those<br><br>New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear<br><br>the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I<br><br>should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm<br><br>Whale in this particular.  It also seems to me that such scratches in<br><br>the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for<br><br>I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the<br><br>species.<br><br><br><br>A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of<br><br>the whale.  It has already been said, that it is stript from him in<br><br>long pieces, called blanket-pieces.  Like most sea-terms, this one is<br><br>very happy and significant.  For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his<br><br>blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an<br><br>Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity.  It is<br><br>by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is<br><br>enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas,<br><br>times, and tides.  What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in<br><br>those shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy<br><br>surtout?  True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those<br><br>Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded,<br><br>lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that<br><br>warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter<br><br>would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs<br><br>and warm blood.  Freeze his blood, and he dies.  How wonderful is it<br><br>then--except after explanation--that this great monster, to whom<br><br>corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful<br><br>that he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in<br><br>those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are<br><br>sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the<br><br>hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber.  But more<br><br>surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the<br><br>blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in<br><br>summer.<br><br><br><br>It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong<br><br>individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare<br><br>virtue of interior spaciousness.  Oh, man! admire and model thyself<br><br>after the whale!  Do thou, too, remain warm among ice.  Do thou, too,<br><br>live in this world without being of it.  Be cool at the equator; keep<br><br>thy blood fluid at the Pole.  Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and<br><br>like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of<br><br>thine own.<br><br><br><br>But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things!  Of<br><br>erections, how few are domed like St. Peter's! of creatures, how few<br><br>vast as the whale!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 69<br><br><br><br>The Funeral.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Haul in the chains!  Let the carcase go astern!<br><br><br><br>The vast tackles have now done their duty.  The peeled white body of<br><br>the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in<br><br>hue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk.  It is still<br><br>colossal.  Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it<br><br>torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed<br><br>with rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so<br><br>many insulting poniards in the whale.  The vast white headless<br><br>phantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that<br><br>it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of<br><br>fowls, augment the murderous din.  For hours and hours from the<br><br>almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.  Beneath the<br><br>unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,<br><br>wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and<br><br>on, till lost in infinite perspectives.<br><br><br><br>There's a most doleful and most mocking funeral!  The sea-vultures<br><br>all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or<br><br>speckled.  In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I<br><br>ween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his<br><br>funeral they most piously do pounce.  Oh, horrible vultureism of<br><br>earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.<br><br><br><br>Nor is this the end.  Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost<br><br>survives and hovers over it to scare.  Espied by some timid<br><br>man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the<br><br>distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the<br><br>white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high<br><br>against it; straightway the whale's unharming corpse, with trembling<br><br>fingers is set down in the log--SHOALS, ROCKS, AND BREAKERS<br><br>HEREABOUTS: BEWARE!

Remember, also,<br><br>that the surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet<br><br>intervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost<br><br>hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and<br><br>bursting sea.  Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward<br><br>circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that<br><br>subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single peep into<br><br>the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer clear<br><br>of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a<br><br>critical point hard by its insertion into the skull.  Do you not<br><br>marvel, then, at Stubb's boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to<br><br>behead a sperm whale?<br><br><br><br>When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a<br><br>cable till the body is stripped.  That done, if it belong to a small<br><br>whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of.  But,<br><br>with a full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale's<br><br>head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to<br><br>suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a<br><br>whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn<br><br>in jewellers' scales.<br><br><br><br>The Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head<br><br>was hoisted against the ship's side--about half way out of the sea,<br><br>so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native<br><br>element.  And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it,<br><br>by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and<br><br>every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves;<br><br>there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's waist like the<br><br>giant Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith.<br><br><br><br>When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went<br><br>below to their dinner.  Silence reigned over the before tumultuous<br><br>but now deserted deck.  An intense copper calm, like a universal<br><br>yellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless<br><br>leaves upon the sea.<br><br><br><br>A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone<br><br>from his cabin.  Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to<br><br>gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took<br><br>Stubb's long spade--still remaining there after the whale's<br><br>Decapitation--and striking it into the lower part of the<br><br>half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm,<br><br>and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.<br><br><br><br>It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so<br><br>intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert.  "Speak, thou<br><br>vast and venerable head," muttered Ahab, "which, though ungarnished<br><br>with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,<br><br>mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all<br><br>divers, thou hast dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper<br><br>sun now gleams, has moved amid this world's foundations.  Where<br><br>unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot;<br><br>where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with<br><br>bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land,<br><br>there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or diver<br><br>never went; hast slept by many a sailor's side, where sleepless<br><br>mothers would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw'st the<br><br>locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart<br><br>they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven<br><br>seemed false to them.  Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed by<br><br>pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper<br><br>midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on<br><br>unharmed--while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that<br><br>would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.<br><br>O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an<br><br>infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"<br><br><br><br>"Sail ho!" cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.<br><br><br><br>"Aye?  Well, now, that's cheering," cried Ahab, suddenly erecting<br><br>himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.  "That<br><br>lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better<br><br>man.--Where away?"<br><br><br><br>"Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze<br><br>to us!<br><br><br><br>"Better and better, man.  Would now St. Paul would come along that<br><br>way, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze!

But as she was so far to<br><br>windward, and shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other<br><br>ground, the Pequod could not hope to reach her.  So the signal was<br><br>set to see what response would be made.<br><br><br><br>Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships<br><br>of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which<br><br>signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective<br><br>vessels attached, every captain is provided with it.  Thereby, the<br><br>whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean,<br><br>even at considerable distances and with no small facility.<br><br><br><br>The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's<br><br>setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of<br><br>Nantucket.  Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the<br><br>Pequod's lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the<br><br>side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck's order to accommodate the<br><br>visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his<br><br>boat's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary.<br><br>It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board,<br><br>and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod's<br><br>company.  For, though himself and boat's crew remained untainted, and<br><br>though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea<br><br>and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to<br><br>the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come<br><br>into direct contact with the Pequod.<br><br><br><br>But this did by no means prevent all communications.  Preserving an<br><br>interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the<br><br>Jeroboam's boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep<br><br>parallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by<br><br>this time it blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though,<br><br>indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the<br><br>boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully<br><br>brought to her proper bearings again.  Subject to this, and other the<br><br>like interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained between<br><br>the two parties; but at intervals not without still another<br><br>interruption of a very different sort.<br><br><br><br>Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular<br><br>appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual<br><br>notabilities make up all totalities.  He was a small, short, youngish<br><br>man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant<br><br>yellow hair.  A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded<br><br>walnut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were<br><br>rolled up on his wrists.  A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in<br><br>his eyes.<br><br><br><br>So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had<br><br>exclaimed--"That's he! that's he!--the long-togged scaramouch the<br><br>Town-Ho's company told us of!"  Stubb here alluded to a strange story<br><br>told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time<br><br>previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho.  According to this<br><br>account and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the<br><br>scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost<br><br>everybody in the Jeroboam.  His story was this:<br><br><br><br>He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna<br><br>Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret<br><br>meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a<br><br>trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which<br><br>he carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing<br><br>gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum.  A strange,<br><br>apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for<br><br>Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed<br><br>a steady, common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand<br><br>candidate for the Jeroboam's whaling voyage.  They engaged him; but<br><br>straightway upon the ship's getting out of sight of land, his<br><br>insanity broke out in a freshet.  He announced himself as the<br><br>archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard.  He<br><br>published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the<br><br>deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica.<br><br>The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things;--the<br><br>dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the<br><br>preternatural terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel<br><br>in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere<br><br>of sacredness.  Moreover, they were afraid of him.  As such a man,<br><br>however, was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he<br><br>refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would<br><br>fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual's<br><br>intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel<br><br>forthwith opened all his seals and vials--devoting the ship and all<br><br>hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried<br><br>out.  So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that<br><br>at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel<br><br>was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain.  He was<br><br>therefore forced to relinquish his plan.  Nor would they permit<br><br>Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it<br><br>came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship.  The<br><br>consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or<br><br>nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken<br><br>out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague,<br><br>as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but<br><br>according to his good pleasure.  The sailors, mostly poor devils,<br><br>cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his<br><br>instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.<br><br>Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are<br><br>true.  Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to<br><br>the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his<br><br>measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.  But<br><br>it is time to return to the Pequod.<br><br><br><br>"I fear not thy epidemic, man," said Ahab from the bulwarks, to<br><br>Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern; "come on board."<br><br><br><br>But now Gabriel started to his feet.<br><br><br><br>"Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious!  Beware of the<br><br>horrible plague!"<br><br><br><br>"Gabriel!  Gabriel!" cried Captain Mayhew; "thou must either--"  But<br><br>that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its<br><br>seethings drowned all speech.<br><br><br><br>"Hast thou seen the White Whale?" demanded Ahab, when the boat<br><br>drifted back.<br><br><br><br>"Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk!  Beware of the<br><br>horrible tail!"<br><br><br><br>"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that--"  But again the boat tore ahead<br><br>as if dragged by fiends.  Nothing was said for some moments, while a<br><br>succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those<br><br>occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it.<br><br>Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently,<br><br>and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than<br><br>his archangel nature seemed to warrant.<br><br><br><br>When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story<br><br>concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions<br><br>from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that<br><br>seemed leagued with him.<br><br><br><br>It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon<br><br>speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the<br><br>existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.  Greedily sucking<br><br>in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against<br><br>attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his<br><br>gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being<br><br>than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.  But<br><br>when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from<br><br>the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter<br><br>him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the<br><br>opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and<br><br>forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.<br><br>With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many<br><br>perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one<br><br>iron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,<br><br>was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies<br><br>of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.  Now,<br><br>while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with<br><br>all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild<br><br>exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for<br><br>his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its<br><br>quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the<br><br>bodies of the oarsmen.  Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of<br><br>furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc<br><br>in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty<br><br>yards.  Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any<br><br>oarsman's head; but the mate for ever sank.<br><br><br><br>It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the<br><br>Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.<br><br>Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;<br><br>oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which<br><br>the headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.<br><br>But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances<br><br>than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of<br><br>violence is discernible; the man being stark dead.<br><br><br><br>The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly<br><br>descried from the ship.  Raising a piercing shriek--"The vial! the<br><br>vial!"  Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further<br><br>hunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel with<br><br>added influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had<br><br>specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general<br><br>prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit<br><br>one of many marks in the wide margin allowed.  He became a nameless<br><br>terror to the ship.<br><br><br><br>Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to<br><br>him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he<br><br>intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer.  To<br><br>which Ahab answered--"Aye."  Straightway, then, Gabriel once more<br><br>started to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently<br><br>exclaimed, with downward pointed finger--"Think, think of the<br><br>blasphemer--dead, and down there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!"<br><br><br><br>Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, "Captain, I have<br><br>just bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy<br><br>officers, if I mistake not.  Starbuck, look over the bag."<br><br><br><br>Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various<br><br>ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,<br><br>depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.<br><br>Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only<br><br>received after attaining an age of two or three years or more.<br><br><br><br>Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand.  It was sorely<br><br>tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in<br><br>consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin.  Of such a<br><br>letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.<br><br><br><br>"Can'st not read it?" cried Ahab.  "Give it me, man.  Aye, aye, it's<br><br>but a dim scrawl;--what's this?"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck<br><br>took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the<br><br>end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the<br><br>boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.<br><br><br><br>Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, "Mr. Har--yes, Mr.<br><br>Harry--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife, I'll wager)--Aye--Mr.<br><br>Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it's Macey, and he's dead!"<br><br><br><br>"Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife," sighed Mayhew; "but<br><br>let me have it."<br><br><br><br>"Nay, keep it thyself," cried Gabriel to Ahab; "thou art soon going<br><br>that way."<br><br><br><br>"Curses throttle thee!" yelled Ahab.  "Captain Mayhew, stand by now<br><br>to receive it"; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck's hands,<br><br>he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the<br><br>boat.  But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from<br><br>rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that,<br><br>as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager<br><br>hand.  He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and<br><br>impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.<br><br>It fell at Ahab's feet.  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to<br><br>give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat<br><br>rapidly shot away from the Pequod.<br><br><br><br>As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the<br><br>jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to<br><br>this wild affair.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 72<br><br><br><br>The Monkey-Rope.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,<br><br>there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.  Now<br><br>hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there.  There<br><br>is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time<br><br>everything has to be done everywhere.  It is much the same with him<br><br>who endeavors the description of the scene.  We must now retrace our<br><br>way a little.  It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in<br><br>the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original<br><br>hole there cut by the spades of the mates.  But how did so clumsy and<br><br>weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?  It was<br><br>inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was,<br><br>as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special<br><br>purpose referred to.  But in very many cases, circumstances require<br><br>that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing<br><br>or stripping operation is concluded.  The whale, be it observed, lies<br><br>almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated<br><br>upon.  So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the<br><br>poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the<br><br>water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.  On<br><br>the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--a<br><br>shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to<br><br>uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as<br><br>will presently be seen.<br><br><br><br>Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the<br><br>bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful<br><br>duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon<br><br>the dead whale's back.  You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a<br><br>dancing-ape by a long cord.  Just so, from the ship's steep side, did<br><br>I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called<br><br>in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas<br><br>belted round his waist.<br><br><br><br>It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we<br><br>proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at<br><br>both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my<br><br>narrow leather one.  So that for better or for worse, we two, for the<br><br>time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more,<br><br>then both usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord,<br><br>it should drag me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese<br><br>ligature united us.  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother;<br><br>nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the<br><br>hempen bond entailed.<br><br><br><br>So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,<br><br>that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to<br><br>perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock<br><br>company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and<br><br>that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into<br><br>unmerited disaster and death.  Therefore, I saw that here was a sort<br><br>of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could<br><br>have so gross an injustice.  And yet still further pondering--while I<br><br>jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would<br><br>threaten to jam him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this<br><br>situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that<br><br>breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese<br><br>connexion with a plurality of other mortals.  If your banker breaks,<br><br>you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your<br><br>pills, you die.  True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you<br><br>may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of<br><br>life.  But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would,<br><br>sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard.<br><br>Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the<br><br>management of one end of it.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the<br><br>Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together.  This<br><br>improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man<br><br>than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest<br><br>possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his<br><br>monkey-rope holder.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the<br><br>whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the<br><br>incessant rolling and swaying of both.  But this was not the only<br><br>jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.  Unappalled by the massacre made<br><br>upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly<br><br>allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the<br><br>carcass--the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.<br><br><br><br>And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them<br><br>aside with his floundering feet.  A thing altogether incredible were<br><br>it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise<br><br>miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.<br><br><br><br>Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a<br><br>ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to<br><br>them.  Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and<br><br>then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of<br><br>what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still<br><br>another protection.  Suspended over the side in one of the stages,<br><br>Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of<br><br>keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they<br><br>could reach.  This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very<br><br>disinterested and benevolent of them.  They meant Queequeg's best<br><br>happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from<br><br>the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half<br><br>hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs<br><br>would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.  But poor Queequeg, I<br><br>suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook--poor<br><br>Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life<br><br>into the hands of his gods.<br><br><br><br>Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in<br><br>and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea--what matters<br><br>it, after all?  Are you not the precious image of each and all of us<br><br>men in this whaling world?  That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is<br><br>Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what<br><br>between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor<br><br>lad.<br><br><br><br>But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg.  For<br><br>now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at<br><br>last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily<br><br>trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,<br><br>consolatory glance hands him--what?  Some hot Cognac?  No! hands him,<br><br>ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!<br><br><br><br>"Ginger?  Do I smell ginger?" suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.<br><br>"Yes, this must be ginger," peering into the as yet untasted cup.<br><br>Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards<br><br>the astonished steward slowly saying, "Ginger? ginger? and will you<br><br>have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of<br><br>ginger?  Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to<br><br>kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?  Ginger!--what the devil is<br><br>ginger?--sea-coal? firewood?--lucifer<br><br>matches?--tinder?--gunpowder?--what the devil is ginger, I say, that<br><br>you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here."<br><br><br><br>"There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this<br><br>business," he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just<br><br>come from forward.  "Will you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of<br><br>it, if you please."  Then watching the mate's countenance, he added,<br><br>"The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and<br><br>jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale.  Is the steward<br><br>an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters<br><br>by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?"<br><br><br><br>"I trust not," said Starbuck, "it is poor stuff enough."<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye, steward," cried Stubb, "we'll teach you to drug it<br><br>harpooneer; none of your apothecary's medicine here; you want to<br><br>poison us, do ye?  You have got out insurances on our lives and want<br><br>to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?"<br><br><br><br>"It was not me," cried Dough-Boy, "it was Aunt Charity that brought<br><br>the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any<br><br>spirits, but only this ginger-jub--so she called it."<br><br><br><br>"Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to<br><br>the lockers, and get something better.  I hope I do no wrong, Mr.<br><br>Starbuck.  It is the captain's orders--grog for the harpooneer on a<br><br>whale."<br><br><br><br>"Enough," replied Starbuck, "only don't hit him again, but--"<br><br><br><br>"Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something<br><br>of that sort; and this fellow's a weazel.  What were you about<br><br>saying, sir?"<br><br><br><br>"Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself."<br><br><br><br>When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a<br><br>sort of tea-caddy in the other.  The first contained strong spirits,<br><br>and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift, and<br><br>that was freely given to the waves.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 73<br><br><br><br>Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk Over Him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale's<br><br>prodigious head hanging to the Pequod's side.  But we must let it<br><br>continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to<br><br>it.  For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now<br><br>for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.<br><br><br><br>Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually<br><br>drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,<br><br>gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the<br><br>Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking<br><br>anywhere near.  And though all hands commonly disdained the capture<br><br>of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not<br><br>commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed<br><br>numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now<br><br>that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the<br><br>surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should<br><br>be captured that day, if opportunity offered.<br><br><br><br>Nor was this long wanting.  Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two<br><br>boats, Stubb's and Flask's, were detached in pursuit.  Pulling<br><br>further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the<br><br>men at the mast-head.  But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great<br><br>heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft<br><br>that one or both the boats must be fast.  An interval passed and the<br><br>boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards<br><br>the ship by the towing whale.  So close did the monster come to the<br><br>hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly<br><br>going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly<br><br>disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel.  "Cut, cut!" was<br><br>the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on<br><br>the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's<br><br>side.  But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not<br><br>sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the<br><br>same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship.<br><br>For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while<br><br>they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still<br><br>plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take<br><br>them under.  But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain.<br><br>And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift<br><br>tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the<br><br>strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under<br><br>her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings,<br><br>that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the<br><br>whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to<br><br>fly.  But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his<br><br>course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after<br><br>him, so that they performed a complete circuit.<br><br><br><br>Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close<br><br>flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for<br><br>lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the<br><br>multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale's<br><br>body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking<br><br>at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting<br><br>fountains that poured from the smitten rock.<br><br><br><br>At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he<br><br>turned upon his back a corpse.<br><br><br><br>While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his<br><br>flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing,<br><br>some conversation ensued between them.<br><br><br><br>"I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard," said<br><br>Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with<br><br>so ignoble a leviathan.<br><br><br><br>"Wants with it?" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat's<br><br>bow, "did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm<br><br>Whale's head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a<br><br>Right Whale's on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that<br><br>ship can never afterwards capsize?"<br><br><br><br>"Why not?<br><br><br><br>"I don't know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying<br><br>so, and he seems to know all about ships' charms.  But I sometimes<br><br>think he'll charm the ship to no good at last.  I don't half like<br><br>that chap, Stubb.  Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort<br><br>of carved into a snake's head, Stubb?"<br><br><br><br>"Sink him!  I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of<br><br>a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by;<br><br>look down there, Flask"--pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion<br><br>of both hands--"Aye, will I!  Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the<br><br>devil in disguise.  Do you believe that cock and bull story about his<br><br>having been stowed away on board ship?  He's the devil, I say.  The<br><br>reason why you don't see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of<br><br>sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess.  Blast him!<br><br>now that I think of it, he's always wanting oakum to stuff into the<br><br>toes of his boots."<br><br><br><br>"He sleeps in his boots, don't he?  He hasn't got any hammock; but<br><br>I've seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging."<br><br><br><br>"No doubt, and it's because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do<br><br>ye see, in the eye of the rigging."<br><br><br><br>"What's the old man have so much to do with him for?"<br><br><br><br>"Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose."<br><br><br><br>"Bargain?--about what?"<br><br><br><br>"Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and<br><br>the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away<br><br>his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then<br><br>he'll surrender Moby Dick."<br><br><br><br>"Pooh!  Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?"<br><br><br><br>"I don't know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked<br><br>one, I tell ye.  Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the<br><br>old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and<br><br>gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home.  Well,<br><br>he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted.  The devil,<br><br>switching his hoofs, up and says, 'I want John.'  'What for?' says<br><br>the old governor.  'What business is that of yours,' says the devil,<br><br>getting mad,--'I want to use him.'  'Take him,' says the<br><br>governor--and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn't give John the<br><br>Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I'll eat this whale<br><br>in one mouthful.  But look sharp--ain't you all ready there?  Well,<br><br>then, pull ahead, and let's get the whale alongside."<br><br><br><br>"I think I remember some such story as you were telling," said Flask,<br><br>when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden<br><br>towards the ship, "but I can't remember where."<br><br><br><br>"Three Spaniards?  Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes?<br><br>Did ye read it there, Flask?  I guess ye did?"<br><br><br><br>"No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though.  But now, tell me,<br><br>Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now,<br><br>was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?"<br><br><br><br>"Am I the same man that helped kill this whale?  Doesn't the devil<br><br>live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead?  Did you ever<br><br>see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil?  And if the devil<br><br>has a latch-key to get into the admiral's cabin, don't you suppose he<br><br>can crawl into a porthole?  Tell me that, Mr. Flask?"<br><br><br><br>"How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?"<br><br><br><br>"Do you see that mainmast there?" pointing to the ship; "well, that's<br><br>the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod's hold, and<br><br>string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well,<br><br>that wouldn't begin to be Fedallah's age.  Nor all the coopers in<br><br>creation couldn't show hoops enough to make oughts enough."<br><br><br><br>"But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that<br><br>you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance.<br><br>Now, if he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is<br><br>going to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him<br><br>overboard--tell me that?<br><br><br><br>"Give him a good ducking, anyhow."<br><br><br><br>"But he'd crawl back."<br><br><br><br>"Duck him again; and keep ducking him."<br><br><br><br>"Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though--yes,<br><br>and drown you--what then?"<br><br><br><br>"I should like to see him try it; I'd give him such a pair of black<br><br>eyes that he wouldn't dare to show his face in the admiral's cabin<br><br>again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he<br><br>lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much.<br><br>Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I'm afraid of the devil?  Who's<br><br>afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn't catch him and put<br><br>him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about<br><br>kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the<br><br>people the devil kidnapped, he'd roast for him?  There's a governor!"<br><br><br><br>"Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?"<br><br><br><br>"Do I suppose it?  You'll know it before long, Flask.  But I am going<br><br>now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very<br><br>suspicious going on, I'll just take him by the nape of his neck, and<br><br>say--Look here, Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes any fuss,<br><br>by the Lord I'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to<br><br>the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail<br><br>will come short off at the stump--do you see; and then, I rather<br><br>guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he'll sneak<br><br>off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his<br><br>legs."<br><br><br><br>"And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?"<br><br><br><br>"Do with it?  Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;--what else?"<br><br><br><br>"Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along,<br><br>Stubb?"<br><br><br><br>"Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship."<br><br><br><br>The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,<br><br>where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for<br><br>securing him.<br><br><br><br>"Didn't I tell you so?" said Flask; "yes, you'll soon see this right<br><br>whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti's."<br><br><br><br>In good time, Flask's saying proved true.  As before, the Pequod<br><br>steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale's head, now, by the<br><br>counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely<br><br>strained, you may well believe.  So, when on one side you hoist in<br><br>Locke's head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist<br><br>in Kant's and you come back again; but in very poor plight.  Thus,<br><br>some minds for ever keep trimming boat.  Oh, ye foolish! throw all<br><br>these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and<br><br>right.<br><br><br><br>In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the<br><br>ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the<br><br>case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut<br><br>off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately<br><br>removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone<br><br>attached to what is called the crown-piece.  But nothing like this,<br><br>in the present case, had been done.  The carcases of both whales had<br><br>dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule<br><br>carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.<br><br><br><br>Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head, and ever<br><br>and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his<br><br>own hand.  And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his<br><br>shadow; while, if the Parsee's shadow was there at all it seemed only<br><br>to blend with, and lengthen Ahab's.  As the crew toiled on,<br><br>Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these<br><br>passing things.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 74<br><br><br><br>The Sperm Whale's Head--Contrasted View.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us<br><br>join them, and lay together our own.<br><br><br><br>Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right<br><br>Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales<br><br>regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two<br><br>extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external<br><br>difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a<br><br>head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we<br><br>may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the<br><br>deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance<br><br>to study practical cetology than here?<br><br><br><br>In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between<br><br>these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there<br><br>is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the<br><br>Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm<br><br>Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense<br><br>superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present<br><br>instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt<br><br>colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and<br><br>large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically<br><br>call a "grey-headed whale."<br><br><br><br>Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the<br><br>two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side<br><br>of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if<br><br>you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you<br><br>would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it<br><br>to the magnitude of the head.<br><br><br><br>Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is<br><br>plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more<br><br>than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the<br><br>whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,<br><br>for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey<br><br>objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only<br><br>command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight<br><br>side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your<br><br>bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted<br><br>in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he<br><br>were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two<br><br>backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side<br><br>fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,<br><br>but his eyes?<br><br><br><br>Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the<br><br>eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so<br><br>as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar<br><br>position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many<br><br>cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great<br><br>mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must<br><br>wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.<br><br>The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,<br><br>and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be<br><br>profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be<br><br>said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined<br><br>sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are<br><br>separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing<br><br>the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to<br><br>be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader<br><br>in some subsequent scenes.<br><br><br><br>A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this<br><br>visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with<br><br>a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of<br><br>seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically<br><br>seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's<br><br>experience will teach him, that though he can take in an<br><br>undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite<br><br>impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two<br><br>things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant<br><br>of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.<br><br>But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each<br><br>by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,<br><br>in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will<br><br>be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,<br><br>then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must<br><br>simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,<br><br>combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of<br><br>time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of<br><br>him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then<br><br>is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able<br><br>simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct<br><br>problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any<br><br>incongruity in this comparison.<br><br><br><br>It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the<br><br>extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when<br><br>beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer<br><br>frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly<br><br>proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their<br><br>divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve<br><br>them.<br><br><br><br>But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.  If you are<br><br>an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads<br><br>for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external<br><br>leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a<br><br>quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the<br><br>eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be<br><br>observed between the sperm whale and the right.  While the ear of<br><br>the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely<br><br>and evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite<br><br>imperceptible from without.<br><br><br><br>Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the<br><br>world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear<br><br>which is smaller than a hare's?  But if his eyes were broad as the<br><br>lens of Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the<br><br>porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or<br><br>sharper of hearing?  Not at all.--Why then do you try to "enlarge"<br><br>your mind?  Subtilize it.<br><br><br><br>Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand,<br><br>cant over the sperm whale's head, that it may lie bottom up;<br><br>then, ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the<br><br>mouth; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from<br><br>it, with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth<br><br>Cave of his stomach.  But let us hold on here by this tooth, and look<br><br>about us where we are.  What a really beautiful and chaste-looking<br><br>mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a<br><br>glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.<br><br><br><br>But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems<br><br>like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at<br><br>one end, instead of one side.  If you pry it up, so as to get it<br><br>overhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific<br><br>portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the<br><br>fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force.  But far<br><br>more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see<br><br>some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious jaw,<br><br>some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at right-angles with<br><br>his body, for all the world like a ship's jib-boom.  This whale is<br><br>not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;<br><br>hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have<br><br>relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a<br><br>reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws<br><br>upon him.<br><br><br><br>In most cases this lower jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised<br><br>artist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of<br><br>extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard<br><br>white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious<br><br>articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to<br><br>riding-whips.<br><br><br><br>With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were<br><br>an anchor; and when the proper time comes--some few days after the<br><br>other work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished<br><br>dentists, are set to drawing teeth.  With a keen cutting-spade,<br><br>Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts,<br><br>and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as<br><br>Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands.  There<br><br>are generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down,<br><br>but undecayed; nor filled after our artificial fashion.  The jaw is<br><br>afterwards sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists for building<br><br>houses.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 75<br><br><br><br>The Right Whale's Head--Contrasted View.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right<br><br>Whale's head.<br><br><br><br>As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared to a<br><br>Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly<br><br>rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head bears a rather<br><br>inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe.  Two hundred<br><br>years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a<br><br>shoemaker's last.  And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of<br><br>the nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be<br><br>lodged, she and all her progeny.<br><br><br><br>But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume<br><br>different aspects, according to your point of view.  If you stand on<br><br>its summit and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take<br><br>the whole head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the<br><br>apertures in its sounding-board.  Then, again, if you fix your eye<br><br>upon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the<br><br>mass--this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the<br><br>"crown," and the Southern fishers the "bonnet" of the Right Whale;<br><br>fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the<br><br>trunk of some huge oak, with a bird's nest in its crotch.  At any<br><br>rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this<br><br>bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless,<br><br>indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term "crown" also<br><br>bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in<br><br>thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the<br><br>sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this<br><br>marvellous manner.  But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky<br><br>looking fellow to grace a diadem.  Look at that hanging lower lip!<br><br>what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's<br><br>measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and<br><br>pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.<br><br><br><br>A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.<br><br>The fissure is about a foot across.  Probably the mother during an<br><br>important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when<br><br>earthquakes caused the beach to gape.  Over this lip, as over a<br><br>slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth.  Upon my word were I<br><br>at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam.<br><br>Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went?  The roof is about<br><br>twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were<br><br>a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides,<br><br>present us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats<br><br>of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which depending from the<br><br>upper part of the head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds<br><br>which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned.  The edges of these<br><br>bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale<br><br>strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small<br><br>fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding<br><br>time.  In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural<br><br>order, there are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges,<br><br>whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age, as the age of an<br><br>oak by its circular rings.  Though the certainty of this criterion is<br><br>far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical<br><br>probability.  At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far<br><br>greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem<br><br>reasonable.<br><br><br><br>In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies<br><br>concerning these blinds.  One voyager in Purchas calls them the<br><br>wondrous "whiskers" inside of the whale's mouth;* another, "hogs'<br><br>bristles"; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following<br><br>elegant language: "There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing<br><br>on each side of his upper CHOP, which arch over his tongue on each<br><br>side of his mouth."<br><br><br><br><br><br>*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker,<br><br>or rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on<br><br>the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw.  Sometimes these<br><br>tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn<br><br>countenance.<br><br><br><br><br><br>As every one knows, these same "hogs' bristles," "fins," "whiskers,"<br><br>"blinds," or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks<br><br>and other stiffening contrivances.  But in this particular, the<br><br>demand has long been on the decline.  It was in Queen Anne's time<br><br>that the bone was in its glory, the farthingale being then all the<br><br>fashion.  And as those ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the<br><br>jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with the<br><br>like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for<br><br>protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.<br><br><br><br>But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,<br><br>standing in the Right Whale's mouth, look around you afresh.  Seeing<br><br>all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you<br><br>not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing<br><br>upon its thousand pipes?  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of<br><br>the softest Turkey--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the<br><br>floor of the mouth.  It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in<br><br>pieces in hoisting it on deck.  This particular tongue now before us;<br><br>at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it<br><br>will yield you about that amount of oil.<br><br><br><br>Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started<br><br>with--that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely<br><br>different heads.  To sum up, then: in the Right Whale's there is no<br><br>great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible<br><br>of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's.  Nor in the Sperm Whale are<br><br>there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely<br><br>anything of a tongue.  Again, the Right Whale has two external<br><br>spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.<br><br><br><br>Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet<br><br>lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the<br><br>other will not be very long in following.<br><br><br><br>Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's there?  It is the<br><br>same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead<br><br>seem now faded away.  I think his broad brow to be full of a<br><br>prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to<br><br>death.  But mark the other head's expression.  See that amazing lower<br><br>lip, pressed by accident against the vessel's side, so as firmly to<br><br>embrace the jaw.  Does not this whole head seem to speak of an<br><br>enormous practical resolution in facing death?  This Right Whale I<br><br>take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might<br><br>have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 76<br><br><br><br>The Battering-Ram.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale's head, I would have<br><br>you, as a sensible physiologist, simply--particularly remark its<br><br>front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness.  I would have you<br><br>investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some<br><br>unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power<br><br>may be lodged there.  Here is a vital point; for you must either<br><br>satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain<br><br>an infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true<br><br>events, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.<br><br><br><br>You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm<br><br>Whale, the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane<br><br>to the water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes<br><br>considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the<br><br>long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that<br><br>the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed,<br><br>as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.  Moreover you<br><br>observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he<br><br>has--his spout hole--is on the top of his head; you observe that his<br><br>eyes and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his<br><br>entire length from the front.  Wherefore, you must now have perceived<br><br>that the front of the Sperm Whale's head is a dead, blind wall,<br><br>without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever.<br><br>Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower,<br><br>backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there the<br><br>slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from<br><br>the forehead do you come to the full cranial development.  So that<br><br>this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad.  Finally, though, as<br><br>will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate<br><br>oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance<br><br>which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy.  In some<br><br>previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body<br><br>of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.  Just so with the head;<br><br>but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so<br><br>thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not<br><br>handled it.  The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted<br><br>by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it.  It is as<br><br>though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses' hoofs.<br><br>I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.<br><br><br><br>Bethink yourself also of another thing.  When two large, loaded<br><br>Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the<br><br>docks, what do the sailors do?  They do not suspend between them, at<br><br>the point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or<br><br>wood.  No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork,<br><br>enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide.  That bravely and<br><br>uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken<br><br>handspikes and iron crow-bars.  By itself this sufficiently<br><br>illustrates the obvious fact I drive at.  But supplementary to this,<br><br>it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess<br><br>what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of<br><br>distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know,<br><br>has no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise<br><br>inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether<br><br>beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out of the<br><br>water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope;<br><br>considering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically<br><br>occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs<br><br>there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected<br><br>connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric<br><br>distension and contraction.  If this be so, fancy the<br><br>irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and<br><br>destructive of all elements contributes.<br><br><br><br>Now, mark.  Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable<br><br>wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a<br><br>mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled<br><br>wood is--by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the<br><br>smallest insect.  So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all<br><br>the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in<br><br>this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more<br><br>inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all<br><br>ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the<br><br>Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed<br><br>the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your<br><br>eye-brow.  For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and<br><br>sentimentalist in Truth.  But clear Truth is a thing for salamander<br><br>giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials<br><br>then?  What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess's<br><br>veil at Lais?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 77<br><br><br><br>The Great Heidelburgh Tun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now comes the Baling of the Case.  But to comprehend it aright, you<br><br>must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing<br><br>operated upon.<br><br><br><br>Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, you may, on an<br><br>inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the<br><br>lower is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the<br><br>upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end<br><br>forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale.  At the<br><br>middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and<br><br>then you have two almost equal parts, which before were naturally<br><br>divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.<br><br><br><br><br><br>*Quoin is not a Euclidean term.  It belongs to the pure nautical<br><br>mathematics.  I know not that it has been defined before.  A quoin is<br><br>a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by<br><br>the steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of<br><br>both sides.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb<br><br>of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand<br><br>infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole<br><br>extent.  The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the<br><br>great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale.  And as that famous great<br><br>tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale's vast plaited<br><br>forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical<br><br>adornment of his wondrous tun.  Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was<br><br>always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the<br><br>Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far the most<br><br>precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized<br><br>spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state.<br><br>Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of<br><br>the creature.  Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon<br><br>exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending<br><br>forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate<br><br>ice is just forming in water.  A large whale's case generally yields<br><br>about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable<br><br>circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles<br><br>away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of<br><br>securing what you can.<br><br><br><br>I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was<br><br>coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not<br><br>possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like<br><br>the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm<br><br>Whale's case.<br><br><br><br>It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale<br><br>embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and<br><br>since--as has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces one third<br><br>of the whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at<br><br>eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six<br><br>feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and<br><br>down against a ship's side.<br><br><br><br>As in decapitating the whale, the operator's instrument is brought<br><br>close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the<br><br>spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful,<br><br>lest a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and<br><br>wastingly let out its invaluable contents.  It is this decapitated<br><br>end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water,<br><br>and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose<br><br>hempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in<br><br>that quarter.<br><br><br><br>Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous<br><br>and--in this particular instance--almost fatal operation whereby the<br><br>Sperm Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 78<br><br><br><br>Cistern and Buckets.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his<br><br>erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm,<br><br>to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun.  He has<br><br>carried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two<br><br>parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block.  Securing this<br><br>block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of<br><br>the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck.<br><br>Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through<br><br>the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head.<br><br>There--still high elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he<br><br>vivaciously cries--he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good<br><br>people to prayers from the top of a tower.  A short-handled sharp<br><br>spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper<br><br>place to begin breaking into the Tun.  In this business he proceeds<br><br>very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding<br><br>the walls to find where the gold is masoned in.  By the time this<br><br>cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a<br><br>well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the<br><br>other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or<br><br>three alert hands.  These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of<br><br>the Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.<br><br>Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the<br><br>bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the<br><br>word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all<br><br>bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail of new milk.  Carefully lowered<br><br>from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed<br><br>hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub.  Then remounting aloft,<br><br>it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will<br><br>yield no more.  Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole<br><br>harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some<br><br>twenty feet of the pole have gone down.<br><br><br><br>Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;<br><br>several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at<br><br>once a queer accident happened.  Whether it was that Tashtego, that<br><br>wild Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment<br><br>his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head;<br><br>or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or<br><br>whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without<br><br>stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no<br><br>telling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket<br><br>came suckingly up--my God! poor Tashtego--like the twin reciprocating<br><br>bucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this<br><br>great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went<br><br>clean out of sight!<br><br><br><br>"Man overboard!" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation<br><br>first came to his senses.  "Swing the bucket this way!" and putting<br><br>one foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold<br><br>on the whip itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the<br><br>head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom.<br><br>Meantime, there was a terrible tumult.  Looking over the side, they<br><br>saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the<br><br>surface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous<br><br>idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by<br><br>those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.<br><br><br><br>At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was<br><br>clearing the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting<br><br>tackles--a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable<br><br>horror of all, one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore<br><br>out, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till<br><br>the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg.  The one<br><br>remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed<br><br>every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more<br><br>likely from the violent motions of the head.<br><br><br><br>"Come down, come down!" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one<br><br>hand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should<br><br>drop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the<br><br>foul line, rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well,<br><br>meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted<br><br>out.<br><br><br><br>"In heaven's name, man," cried Stubb, "are you ramming home a<br><br>cartridge there?--Avast!  How will that help him; jamming that<br><br>iron-bound bucket on top of his head?  Avast, will ye!"<br><br><br><br>"Stand clear of the tackle!" cried a voice like the bursting of a<br><br>rocket.<br><br><br><br>Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass<br><br>dropped into the sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock into the whirlpool;<br><br>the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her<br><br>glittering copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging--now<br><br>over the sailors' heads, and now over the water--Daggoo, through a<br><br>thick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous<br><br>tackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down<br><br>to the bottom of the sea!  But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared<br><br>away, when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for<br><br>one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks.  The next, a loud<br><br>splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue.  One<br><br>packed rush was made to the side, and every eye counted every ripple,<br><br>as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the<br><br>diver could be seen.  Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside,<br><br>and pushed a little off from the ship.<br><br><br><br>"Ha! ha!" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging<br><br>perch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm<br><br>thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm<br><br>thrust forth from the grass over a grave.<br><br><br><br>"Both! both!--it is both!"--cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout;<br><br>and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand,<br><br>and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian.  Drawn into<br><br>the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego<br><br>was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.<br><br><br><br>Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?  Why, diving after<br><br>the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made<br><br>side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;<br><br>then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and<br><br>upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head.  He averred, that<br><br>upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well<br><br>knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great<br><br>trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and<br><br>toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next<br><br>trial, he came forth in the good old way--head foremost.  As for the<br><br>great head itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.<br><br><br><br>And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of<br><br>Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was<br><br>successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward<br><br>and apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to<br><br>be forgotten.  Midwifery should be taught in the same course with<br><br>fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.<br><br><br><br>I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be sure to<br><br>seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have<br><br>either seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore; an<br><br>accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than<br><br>the Indian's, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of<br><br>the Sperm Whale's well.<br><br><br><br>But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?  We<br><br>thought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the<br><br>lightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink<br><br>in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself.  We have<br><br>thee there.  Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash<br><br>fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents,<br><br>leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well--a double<br><br>welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than<br><br>the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost.  But<br><br>the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present<br><br>instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head<br><br>remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and<br><br>deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing<br><br>his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.  Yes, it was a<br><br>running delivery, so it was.<br><br><br><br>Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious<br><br>perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant<br><br>spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber<br><br>and sanctum sanctorum of the whale.  Only one sweeter end can readily<br><br>be recalled--the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking<br><br>honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of<br><br>it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died<br><br>embalmed.  How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato's<br><br>honey head, and sweetly perished there?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 79<br><br><br><br>The Prairie.<br><br><br><br><br><br>To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this<br><br>Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has<br><br>as yet undertaken.  Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful<br><br>as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of<br><br>Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the<br><br>Dome of the Pantheon.  Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater<br><br>not only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively<br><br>studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in<br><br>detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein.  Nor<br><br>have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints<br><br>touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man.<br><br>Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the<br><br>application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my<br><br>endeavor.  I try all things; I achieve what I can.<br><br><br><br>Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature.<br><br>He has no proper nose.  And since the nose is the central and most<br><br>conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and<br><br>finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that<br><br>its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely<br><br>affect the countenance of the whale.  For as in landscape gardening,<br><br>a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost<br><br>indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be<br><br>physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of<br><br>the nose.  Dash the nose from Phidias's marble Jove, and what a sorry<br><br>remainder!  Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all<br><br>his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the<br><br>sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.  Nay, it<br><br>is an added grandeur.  A nose to the whale would have been<br><br>impertinent.  As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his<br><br>vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never<br><br>insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled.  A<br><br>pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even<br><br>when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.<br><br><br><br>In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view<br><br>to be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head.<br><br>This aspect is sublime.<br><br><br><br>In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with<br><br>the morning.  In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the<br><br>bull has a touch of the grand in it.  Pushing heavy cannon up<br><br>mountain defiles, the elephant's brow is majestic.  Human or animal,<br><br>the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German<br><br>Emperors to their decrees.  It signifies--"God: done this day by my<br><br>hand."  But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the<br><br>brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line.<br><br>Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare's or Melancthon's rise<br><br>so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear,<br><br>eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the forehead's<br><br>wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to<br><br>drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.<br><br>But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity<br><br>inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in<br><br>that full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more<br><br>forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature.  For<br><br>you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed;<br><br>no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing<br><br>but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles;<br><br>dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men.  Nor, in<br><br>profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way viewed its<br><br>grandeur does not domineer upon you so.  In profile, you plainly<br><br>perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the<br><br>forehead's middle, which, in man, is Lavater's mark of genius.<br><br><br><br>But how?  Genius in the Sperm Whale?  Has the Sperm Whale ever<br><br>written a book, spoken a speech?  No, his great genius is declared in<br><br>his doing nothing particular to prove it.  It is moreover declared in<br><br>his pyramidical silence.  And this reminds me that had the great<br><br>Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would have been<br><br>deified by their child-magian thoughts.  They deified the crocodile<br><br>of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale<br><br>has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be<br><br>incapable of protrusion.  If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical<br><br>nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods<br><br>of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky;<br><br>in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat,<br><br>the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.<br><br><br><br>Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics.  But there<br><br>is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man's and every<br><br>being's face.  Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a<br><br>passing fable.  If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty<br><br>languages, could not read the simplest peasant's face in its<br><br>profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope<br><br>to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's brow?  I but put that<br><br>brow before you.  Read it if you can.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 80<br><br><br><br>The Nut.<br><br><br><br><br><br>If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist<br><br>his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to<br><br>square.<br><br><br><br>In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty<br><br>feet in length.  Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this<br><br>skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting<br><br>throughout on a level base.  But in life--as we have elsewhere<br><br>seen--this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and almost squared<br><br>by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm.  At the<br><br>high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while<br><br>under the long floor of this crater--in another cavity seldom<br><br>exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth--reposes the<br><br>mere handful of this monster's brain.  The brain is at least twenty<br><br>feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its<br><br>vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified<br><br>fortifications of Quebec.  So like a choice casket is it secreted in<br><br>him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the<br><br>Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one<br><br>formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine.  Lying in strange<br><br>folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems<br><br>more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that<br><br>mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.<br><br><br><br>It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan,<br><br>in the creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion.  As for<br><br>his true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any.<br><br>The whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the<br><br>common world.<br><br><br><br>If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view<br><br>of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its<br><br>resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and<br><br>from the same point of view.  Indeed, place this reversed skull<br><br>(scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls,<br><br>and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the<br><br>depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you<br><br>would say--This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration.  And by<br><br>those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his<br><br>prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest,<br><br>though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted<br><br>potency is.<br><br><br><br>But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain,<br><br>you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have<br><br>another idea for you.  If you attentively regard almost any<br><br>quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its<br><br>vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing<br><br>rudimental resemblance to the skull proper.  It is a German conceit,<br><br>that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls.  But the<br><br>curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the<br><br>first men to perceive.  A foreign friend once pointed it out to me,<br><br>in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of<br><br>which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow<br><br>of his canoe.  Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an<br><br>important thing in not pushing their investigations from the<br><br>cerebellum through the spinal canal.  For I believe that much of a<br><br>man's character will be found betokened in his backbone.  I would<br><br>rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are.  A thin<br><br>joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.  I rejoice<br><br>in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I<br><br>fling half out to the world.<br><br><br><br>Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His<br><br>cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in<br><br>that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches<br><br>across, being eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the<br><br>base downwards.  As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the<br><br>canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of<br><br>large capacity.  Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the<br><br>same strangely fibrous substance--the spinal cord--as the brain; and<br><br>directly communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for<br><br>many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord<br><br>remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.<br><br>Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and<br><br>map out the whale's spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this<br><br>light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is<br><br>more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his<br><br>spinal cord.<br><br><br><br>But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I<br><br>would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to<br><br>the Sperm Whale's hump.  This august hump, if I mistake not, rises<br><br>over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort,<br><br>the outer convex mould of it.  From its relative situation then, I<br><br>should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness<br><br>in the Sperm Whale.  And that the great monster is indomitable, you<br><br>will yet have reason to know.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 81<br><br><br><br>The Pequod Meets The Virgin.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,<br><br>Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.<br><br><br><br>At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and<br><br>Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide<br><br>intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with<br><br>their flag in the Pacific.<br><br><br><br>For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.<br><br>While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and<br><br>dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently<br><br>standing in the bows instead of the stern.<br><br><br><br>"What has he in his hand there?" cried Starbuck, pointing to<br><br>something wavingly held by the German.  "Impossible!--a lamp-feeder!"<br><br><br><br>"Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck;<br><br>he's coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see<br><br>that big tin can there alongside of him?--that's his boiling water.<br><br>Oh! he's all right, is the Yarman."<br><br><br><br>"Go along with you," cried Flask, "it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.<br><br>He's out of oil, and has come a-begging."<br><br><br><br>However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on<br><br>the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the<br><br>old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a<br><br>thing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer<br><br>did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.<br><br><br><br>As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all<br><br>heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German<br><br>soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately<br><br>turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some<br><br>remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in<br><br>profound darkness--his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a<br><br>single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding<br><br>by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is<br><br>technically called a CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well<br><br>deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.<br><br><br><br>His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his<br><br>ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the<br><br>mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick,<br><br>that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he<br><br>slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.<br><br><br><br>Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German<br><br>boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the<br><br>Pequod's keels.  There were eight whales, an average pod.  Aware of<br><br>their danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight<br><br>before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of<br><br>horses in harness.  They left a great, wide wake, as though<br><br>continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.<br><br><br><br>Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,<br><br>humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as<br><br>by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed<br><br>afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity.  Whether this<br><br>whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is<br><br>not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.<br><br>Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water<br><br>must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad<br><br>muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile<br><br>currents meet.  His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming<br><br>forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn<br><br>shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which<br><br>seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the<br><br>waters behind him to upbubble.<br><br><br><br>"Who's got some paregoric?" said Stubb, "he has the stomach-ache, I'm<br><br>afraid.  Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache!  Adverse<br><br>winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys.  It's the first foul<br><br>wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw<br><br>so before? it must be, he's lost his tiller."<br><br><br><br>As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck<br><br>load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her<br><br>way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then<br><br>partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his<br><br>devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin.  Whether he<br><br>had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were<br><br>hard to say.<br><br><br><br>"Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give ye a sling for that wounded<br><br>arm," cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.<br><br><br><br>"Mind he don't sling thee with it," cried Starbuck.  "Give way, or<br><br>the German will have him."<br><br><br><br>With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this<br><br>one fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most<br><br>valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were<br><br>going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit<br><br>for the time.  At this juncture the Pequod's keels had shot by the<br><br>three German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,<br><br>Derick's boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his<br><br>foreign rivals.  The only thing they feared, was, that from being<br><br>already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron<br><br>before they could completely overtake and pass him.  As for Derick,<br><br>he seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and<br><br>occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the<br><br>other boats.<br><br><br><br>"The ungracious and ungrateful dog!" cried Starbuck; "he mocks and<br><br>dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes<br><br>ago!"--then in his old intense whisper--"Give way, greyhounds!  Dog<br><br>to it!"<br><br><br><br>"I tell ye what it is, men"--cried Stubb to his crew--"it's against<br><br>my religion to get mad; but I'd like to eat that villainous<br><br>Yarman--Pull--won't ye?  Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?  Do<br><br>ye love brandy?  A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man.  Come,<br><br>why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel?  Who's that been dropping<br><br>an anchor overboard--we don't budge an inch--we're becalmed.  Halloo,<br><br>here's grass growing in the boat's bottom--and by the Lord, the mast<br><br>there's budding.  This won't do, boys.  Look at that Yarman!  The<br><br>short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?"<br><br><br><br>"Oh! see the suds he makes!" cried Flask, dancing up and down--"What<br><br>a hump--Oh, DO pile on the beef--lays like a log!  Oh! my lads, DO<br><br>spring--slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads--baked<br><br>clams and muffins--oh, DO, DO, spring,--he's a hundred barreller--don't<br><br>lose him now--don't oh, DON'T!--see that Yarman--Oh,<br><br>won't ye pull for your duff, my lads--such a sog! such a sogger!<br><br>Don't ye love sperm?  There goes three thousand dollars, men!--a<br><br>bank!--a whole bank!  The bank of England!--Oh, DO, DO, DO!--What's<br><br>that Yarman about now?"<br><br><br><br>At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at<br><br>the advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double<br><br>view of retarding his rivals' way, and at the same time economically<br><br>accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.<br><br><br><br>"The unmannerly Dutch dogger!" cried Stubb.  "Pull now, men, like<br><br>fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils.  What<br><br>d'ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in<br><br>two-and-twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead?  What d'ye say?"<br><br><br><br>"I say, pull like god-dam,"--cried the Indian.<br><br><br><br>Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the<br><br>Pequod's three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so<br><br>disposed, momentarily neared him.  In that fine, loose, chivalrous<br><br>attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three<br><br>mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with<br><br>an exhilarating cry of, "There she slides, now!  Hurrah for the<br><br>white-ash breeze!  Down with the Yarman!  Sail over him!"<br><br><br><br>But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all<br><br>their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had<br><br>not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught<br><br>the blade of his midship oarsman.  While this clumsy lubber was<br><br>striving to free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick's<br><br>boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a<br><br>mighty rage;--that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask.<br><br>With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly<br><br>ranged up on the German's quarter.  An instant more, and all four<br><br>boats were diagonically in the whale's immediate wake, while<br><br>stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he<br><br>made.<br><br><br><br>It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight.  The whale was<br><br>now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual<br><br>tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of<br><br>fright.  Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering<br><br>flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically<br><br>sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating<br><br>fin.  So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted<br><br>broken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical<br><br>hawks.  But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make<br><br>known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was<br><br>chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking<br><br>respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him<br><br>unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis<br><br>jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man<br><br>who so pitied.<br><br><br><br>Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's<br><br>boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game,<br><br>Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually<br><br>long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.<br><br><br><br>But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all<br><br>three tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to<br><br>their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed<br><br>their barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their<br><br>three Nantucket irons entered the whale.  Blinding vapours of foam and<br><br>white-fire!  The three boats, in the first fury of the whale's<br><br>headlong rush, bumped the German's aside with such force, that both<br><br>Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over<br><br>by the three flying keels.<br><br><br><br>"Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes," cried Stubb, casting a passing<br><br>glance upon them as he shot by; "ye'll be picked up presently--all<br><br>right--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard's dogs, you<br><br>know--relieve distressed travellers.  Hurrah! this is the way to sail<br><br>now.  Every keel a sunbeam!  Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin<br><br>kettles at the tail of a mad cougar!  This puts me in mind of<br><br>fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain--makes the<br><br>wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that way; and there's<br><br>danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a hill.  Hurrah!<br><br>this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to Davy Jones--all a<br><br>rush down an endless inclined plane!  Hurrah! this whale carries the<br><br>everlasting mail!"<br><br><br><br>But the monster's run was a brief one.  Giving a sudden gasp, he<br><br>tumultuously sounded.  With a grating rush, the three lines flew<br><br>round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in<br><br>them; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding<br><br>would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might,<br><br>they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at<br><br>last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of<br><br>the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the<br><br>blue--the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while<br><br>the three sterns tilted high in the air.  And the whale soon ceasing<br><br>to sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of<br><br>expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.  But<br><br>though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is<br><br>this "holding on," as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp<br><br>barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments<br><br>the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his<br><br>foes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be<br><br>doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but<br><br>reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under<br><br>water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous<br><br>surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000<br><br>square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what<br><br>an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even<br><br>here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a<br><br>whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!<br><br>It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman<br><br>has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with<br><br>all their guns, and stores, and men on board.<br><br><br><br>As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down<br><br>into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any<br><br>sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its<br><br>depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that<br><br>silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing<br><br>and wrenching in agony!  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were<br><br>visible at the bows.  Seems it credible that by three such thin<br><br>threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an<br><br>eight day clock.  Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.<br><br>Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--"Canst<br><br>thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears?<br><br>The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart,<br><br>nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make<br><br>him flee; darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of<br><br>a spear!"  This the creature? this he?  Oh! that unfulfilments should<br><br>follow the prophets.  For with the strength of a thousand thighs in<br><br>his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea,<br><br>to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!<br><br><br><br>In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats<br><br>sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad<br><br>enough to shade half Xerxes' army.  Who can tell how appalling to the<br><br>wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his<br><br>head!<br><br><br><br>"Stand by, men; he stirs," cried Starbuck, as the three lines<br><br>suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to<br><br>them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,<br><br>so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,<br><br>relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the<br><br>boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a<br><br>dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.<br><br><br><br>"Haul in!  Haul in!" cried Starbuck again; "he's rising."<br><br><br><br>The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth<br><br>could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all<br><br>dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two<br><br>ship's lengths of the hunters.<br><br><br><br>His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In most land<br><br>animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their<br><br>veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least<br><br>instantly shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one<br><br>of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure<br><br>of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point<br><br>as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole<br><br>arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary<br><br>pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may<br><br>be said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the<br><br>quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior<br><br>fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a<br><br>considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose<br><br>source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills.<br><br>Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew<br><br>over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they<br><br>were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept<br><br>continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was<br><br>only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture<br><br>into the air.  From this last vent no blood yet came, because no<br><br>vital part of him had thus far been struck.  His life, as they<br><br>significantly call it, was untouched.<br><br><br><br>As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of<br><br>his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly<br><br>revealed.  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been,<br><br>were beheld.  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of<br><br>the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's<br><br>eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable<br><br>to see.  But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one<br><br>arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in<br><br>order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and<br><br>also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional<br><br>inoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last<br><br>he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,<br><br>the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.<br><br><br><br>"A nice spot," cried Flask; "just let me prick him there once."<br><br><br><br>"Avast!" cried Starbuck, "there's no need of that!"<br><br><br><br>But humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart an<br><br>ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more<br><br>than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with<br><br>swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their<br><br>glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat<br><br>and marring the bows.  It was his death stroke.  For, by this time,<br><br>so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from<br><br>the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped<br><br>with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a<br><br>waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a<br><br>log, and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.  As<br><br>when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some<br><br>mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the<br><br>spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--so the last long dying<br><br>spout of the whale.<br><br><br><br>Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body<br><br>showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.<br><br>Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at<br><br>different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken<br><br>whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By<br><br>very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was<br><br>transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the<br><br>stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially<br><br>upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.<br><br><br><br>It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the<br><br>spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in<br><br>his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as<br><br>the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of<br><br>captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no<br><br>prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must<br><br>needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully<br><br>to account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was<br><br>the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from<br><br>the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted<br><br>that stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor'<br><br>West Indian long before America was discovered.<br><br><br><br>What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous<br><br>cabinet there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further<br><br>discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over<br><br>sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing<br><br>tendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of<br><br>affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,<br><br>indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if<br><br>still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the<br><br>command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable<br><br>strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables<br><br>were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime<br><br>everything in the Pequod was aslant.  To cross to the other side of<br><br>the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house.  The<br><br>ship groaned and gasped.  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks<br><br>and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural<br><br>dislocation.  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon<br><br>the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads;<br><br>and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could<br><br>not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of<br><br>ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on<br><br>the point of going over.<br><br><br><br>"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?" cried Stubb to the body, "don't be in<br><br>such a devil of a hurry to sink!  By thunder, men, we must do<br><br>something or go for it.  No use prying there; avast, I say with your<br><br>handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and<br><br>cut the big chains."<br><br><br><br>"Knife?  Aye, aye," cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy<br><br>hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began<br><br>slashing at the largest fluke-chains.  But a few strokes, full of<br><br>sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.<br><br>With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,<br><br>the carcase sank.<br><br><br><br>Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm<br><br>Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately<br><br>accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great<br><br>buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the<br><br>surface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and<br><br>broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their<br><br>bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert<br><br>that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the<br><br>fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in<br><br>him.  But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health, and<br><br>swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm<br><br>flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even<br><br>these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.<br><br><br><br>Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this<br><br>accident than any other species.  Where one of that sort go down,<br><br>twenty Right Whales do.  This difference in the species is no doubt<br><br>imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the<br><br>Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a<br><br>ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But there<br><br>are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,<br><br>the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the<br><br>reason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him; he swells to<br><br>a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.  A<br><br>line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.  In the Shore<br><br>Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right<br><br>Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty<br><br>of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look<br><br>for it when it shall have ascended again.<br><br><br><br>It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard<br><br>from the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again<br><br>lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a<br><br>Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of<br><br>its incredible power of swimming.  Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout<br><br>is so similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by unskilful fishermen it is<br><br>often mistaken for it.  And consequently Derick and all his host were<br><br>now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute.  The Virgin crowding<br><br>all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all<br><br>disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.<br><br><br><br>Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 82<br><br><br><br>The Honour and Glory of Whaling.<br><br><br><br><br><br>There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the<br><br>true method.<br><br><br><br>The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches<br><br>up to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with<br><br>its great honourableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so<br><br>many great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way<br><br>or other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the<br><br>reflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so<br><br>emblazoned a fraternity.<br><br><br><br>The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to<br><br>the eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale<br><br>attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.<br><br>Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore<br><br>arms to succor the distressed, and not to fill men's lamp-feeders.<br><br>Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the<br><br>lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the<br><br>sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off,<br><br>Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the<br><br>monster, and delivered and married the maid.  It was an admirable<br><br>artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the<br><br>present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first<br><br>dart.  And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient<br><br>Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples,<br><br>there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the<br><br>city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical<br><br>bones of the monster that Perseus slew.  When the Romans took Joppa,<br><br>the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph.  What seems most<br><br>singular and suggestively important in this story, is this: it was<br><br>from Joppa that Jonah set sail.<br><br><br><br>Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--indeed, by some<br><br>supposed to be indirectly derived from it--is that famous story of<br><br>St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a<br><br>whale; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely<br><br>jumbled together, and often stand for each other.  "Thou art as a<br><br>lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea," saith Ezekiel;<br><br>hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible<br><br>use that word itself.  Besides, it would much subtract from the glory<br><br>of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of<br><br>the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.<br><br>Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a<br><br>Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale.<br><br><br><br>Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the<br><br>creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely<br><br>represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is<br><br>depicted on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the<br><br>great ignorance of those times, when the true form of the whale was<br><br>unknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus' case, St.<br><br>George's whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and<br><br>considering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only<br><br>a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not<br><br>appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the<br><br>ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no<br><br>other than the great Leviathan himself.  In fact, placed before the<br><br>strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish,<br><br>flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being<br><br>planted before the ark of Israel, his horse's head and both the palms<br><br>of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of<br><br>him remained.  Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a<br><br>whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we<br><br>harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order<br><br>of St. George.  And therefore, let not the knights of that honourable<br><br>company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a<br><br>whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with<br><br>disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are<br><br>much better entitled to St. George's decoration than they.<br><br><br><br>Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long<br><br>remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that<br><br>antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer of rejoicing good<br><br>deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether<br><br>that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted.  It<br><br>nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless,<br><br>indeed, from the inside.  Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of<br><br>involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not<br><br>the whale.  I claim him for one of our clan.<br><br><br><br>But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of<br><br>Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still<br><br>more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa;<br><br>certainly they are very similar.  If I claim the demigod then, why<br><br>not the prophet?<br><br><br><br>Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the<br><br>whole roll of our order.  Our grand master is still to be named; for<br><br>like royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our<br><br>fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves.  That<br><br>wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster,<br><br>which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the<br><br>godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our<br><br>Lord;--Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations,<br><br>has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.  When Brahma, or the<br><br>God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after<br><br>one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to<br><br>preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose<br><br>perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before<br><br>beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained<br><br>something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these<br><br>Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became<br><br>incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost<br><br>depths, rescued the sacred volumes.  Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman,<br><br>then? even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?<br><br><br><br>Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's a<br><br>member-roll for you!

Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this<br><br>historical story of Jonah and the whale.  But then there were some<br><br>sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox<br><br>pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the<br><br>whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those<br><br>traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for<br><br>all that.<br><br><br><br>One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew<br><br>story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,<br><br>embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which<br><br>represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity<br><br>only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right<br><br>Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the<br><br>fishermen have this saying, "A penny roll would choke him"; his<br><br>swallow is so very small.  But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative<br><br>answer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we<br><br>consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily<br><br>lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough<br><br>in the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale's mouth would<br><br>accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the<br><br>players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a<br><br>hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.<br><br><br><br>Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his<br><br>want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely<br><br>in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices.<br><br>But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German<br><br>exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating<br><br>body of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian<br><br>campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.<br><br>Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that<br><br>when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway<br><br>effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a<br><br>whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called "The<br><br>Whale," as some craft are nowadays christened the "Shark," the<br><br>"Gull," the "Eagle."  Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists<br><br>who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely<br><br>meant a life-preserver--an inflated bag of wind--which the endangered<br><br>prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom.  Poor<br><br>Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round.  But he had still<br><br>another reason for his want of faith.  It was this, if I remember<br><br>right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and<br><br>after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'<br><br>journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three<br><br>days' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean<br><br>coast.  How is that?<br><br><br><br>But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within<br><br>that short distance of Nineveh?  Yes.  He might have carried him<br><br>round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.  But not to speak of the<br><br>passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another<br><br>passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would<br><br>involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days,<br><br>not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being<br><br>too shallow for any whale to swim in.  Besides, this idea of Jonah's<br><br>weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the<br><br>honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz,<br><br>its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.<br><br><br><br>But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his<br><br>foolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him,<br><br>seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up<br><br>from the sun and the sea.  I say it only shows his foolish, impious<br><br>pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend<br><br>clergy.  For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of<br><br>Jonah's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a<br><br>signal magnification of the general miracle.  And so it was.<br><br>Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe<br><br>in the historical story of Jonah.  And some three centuries ago, an<br><br>English traveller in old Harris's Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque<br><br>built in honour of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that<br><br>burnt without any oil.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 84<br><br><br><br>Pitchpoling.<br><br><br><br><br><br>To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are<br><br>anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an<br><br>analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom.  Nor is<br><br>it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may<br><br>possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and<br><br>water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object<br><br>in view is to make the boat slide bravely.  Queequeg believed<br><br>strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the<br><br>German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in<br><br>that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the<br><br>side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to<br><br>insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel.  He seemed to be<br><br>working in obedience to some particular presentiment.  Nor did it<br><br>remain unwarranted by the event.<br><br><br><br>Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down<br><br>to them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered<br><br>flight, as of Cleopatra's barges from Actium.<br><br><br><br>Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost.  By great<br><br>exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the<br><br>stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his<br><br>horizontal flight, with added fleetness.  Such unintermitted<br><br>strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably<br><br>extract it.  It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be<br><br>content to lose him.  But to haul the boat up to his flank was<br><br>impossible, he swam so fast and furious.  What then remained?<br><br><br><br>Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and<br><br>countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often<br><br>forced, none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called<br><br>pitchpoling.  Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises<br><br>boasts nothing like it.  It is only indispensable with an inveterate<br><br>running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance<br><br>to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently<br><br>rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.  Steel and wood<br><br>included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the<br><br>staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a<br><br>lighter material--pine.  It is furnished with a small rope called a<br><br>warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the<br><br>hand after darting.<br><br><br><br>But before going further, it is important to mention here, that<br><br>though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance,<br><br>yet it is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently<br><br>successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of<br><br>the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become<br><br>serious drawbacks.  As a general thing, therefore, you must first<br><br>get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.<br><br><br><br>Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness<br><br>and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to<br><br>excel in pitchpoling.  Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed<br><br>bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is<br><br>forty feet ahead.  Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or<br><br>thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb<br><br>whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to<br><br>secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed.<br><br>Then holding the lance full before his waistband's middle, he levels<br><br>it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses<br><br>the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon<br><br>stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air.  He<br><br>minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin.<br><br>Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the<br><br>bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot<br><br>of the whale.  Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.<br><br><br><br>"That drove the spigot out of him!" cried Stubb.  "'Tis July's<br><br>immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today!  Would now, it<br><br>were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old<br><br>Monongahela!  Then, Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a canakin to the<br><br>jet, and we'd drink round it!  Yea, verily, hearts alive, we'd brew<br><br>choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there, and from that<br><br>live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff."<br><br><br><br>Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is<br><br>repeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in<br><br>skilful leash.  The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line<br><br>is slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands,<br><br>and mutely watches the monster die.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 85<br><br><br><br>The Fountain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of<br><br>ages before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the<br><br>sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with<br><br>so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries<br><br>back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of<br><br>the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--that all this<br><br>should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a<br><br>quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of<br><br>December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these<br><br>spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is<br><br>surely a noteworthy thing.<br><br><br><br>Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items<br><br>contingent.  Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their<br><br>gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times<br><br>is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or<br><br>a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the<br><br>surface.  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him<br><br>regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by<br><br>inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.  Wherefore the<br><br>necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.  But he<br><br>cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary<br><br>attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet<br><br>beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no<br><br>connexion with his mouth.  No, he breathes through his spiracle<br><br>alone; and this is on the top of his head.<br><br><br><br>If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function<br><br>indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a<br><br>certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with<br><br>the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not<br><br>think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous<br><br>scientific words.  Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in<br><br>a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his<br><br>nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to<br><br>say, he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,<br><br>this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,<br><br>by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without<br><br>drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle<br><br>of air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is this?  Between his<br><br>ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable<br><br>involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,<br><br>when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated<br><br>blood.  So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,<br><br>he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel<br><br>crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for<br><br>future use in its four supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical fact<br><br>of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded<br><br>upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I<br><br>consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in<br><br>HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I<br><br>mean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale<br><br>will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his<br><br>other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets<br><br>seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he<br><br>rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again,<br><br>to a minute.  Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,<br><br>so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good<br><br>his regular allowance of air.  And not till those seventy breaths are<br><br>told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.<br><br>Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are<br><br>different; but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale<br><br>thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish<br><br>his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,<br><br>too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all<br><br>the fatal hazards of the chase.  For not by hook or by net could<br><br>this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms<br><br>beneath the sunlight.  Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the<br><br>great necessities that strike the victory to thee!<br><br><br><br>In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving<br><br>for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has<br><br>to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will.<br><br>But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his<br><br>time.<br><br><br><br>It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;<br><br>if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,<br><br>then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of<br><br>smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at<br><br>all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so<br><br>clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power<br><br>of smelling.  But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be<br><br>water or whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be<br><br>arrived at on this head.  Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm<br><br>Whale has no proper olfactories.  But what does he want of them?  No<br><br>roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.<br><br><br><br>Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his<br><br>spouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is<br><br>furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward<br><br>retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the<br><br>whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so<br><br>strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.  But then again, what<br><br>has the whale to say?  Seldom have I known any profound being that<br><br>had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out<br><br>something by way of getting a living.  Oh! happy that the world is<br><br>such an excellent listener!<br><br><br><br>Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is<br><br>for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,<br><br>horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a<br><br>little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe<br><br>laid down in a city on one side of a street.  But the question<br><br>returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,<br><br>whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled<br><br>breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in<br><br>at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain<br><br>that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but<br><br>it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water<br><br>through the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing<br><br>would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.<br><br>But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he<br><br>cannot spout even if he would.  Besides, if you regard him very<br><br>closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when<br><br>unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his<br><br>jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.<br><br><br><br>But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?  Speak<br><br>out!  You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can<br><br>you not tell water from air?  My dear sir, in this world it is not so<br><br>easy to settle these plain things.  I have ever found your plain<br><br>things the knottiest of all.  And as for this whale spout, you might<br><br>almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.<br><br><br><br>The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist<br><br>enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls<br><br>from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a<br><br>close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water<br><br>cascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that<br><br>you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know<br><br>that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know<br><br>that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the<br><br>spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the<br><br>whale's head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day<br><br>sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in<br><br>the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of<br><br>water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a<br><br>cavity in a rock filled up with rain.<br><br><br><br>Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching<br><br>the precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him to be<br><br>peering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go with your<br><br>pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.  For even<br><br>when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the<br><br>jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from<br><br>the acridness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who<br><br>coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some<br><br>scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin<br><br>peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the<br><br>spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I<br><br>have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is<br><br>fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.  The wisest thing<br><br>the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly<br><br>spout alone.<br><br><br><br>Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.  My<br><br>hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist.  And besides<br><br>other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations<br><br>touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;<br><br>I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an<br><br>undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores;<br><br>all other whales sometimes are.  He is both ponderous and profound.<br><br>And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound<br><br>beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on,<br><br>there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act<br><br>of thinking deep thoughts.  While composing a little treatise on<br><br>Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere<br><br>long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation<br><br>in the atmosphere over my head.  The invariable moisture of my hair,<br><br>while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin<br><br>shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument<br><br>for the above supposition.<br><br><br><br>And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to<br><br>behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast,<br><br>mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his<br><br>incommunicable contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes<br><br>see it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal<br><br>upon his thoughts.  For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear<br><br>air; they only irradiate vapour.  And so, through all the thick mists<br><br>of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot,<br><br>enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.  And for this I thank God; for<br><br>all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with<br><br>them, have intuitions.  Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions<br><br>of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor<br><br>infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 86<br><br><br><br>The Tail.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,<br><br>and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less<br><br>celestial, I celebrate a tail.<br><br><br><br>Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point<br><br>of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it<br><br>comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty<br><br>square feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two<br><br>broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less<br><br>than an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes<br><br>slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,<br><br>leaving a wide vacancy between.  In no living thing are the lines of<br><br>beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of<br><br>these flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the<br><br>tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.<br><br><br><br>The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut<br><br>into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,<br><br>middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are<br><br>long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running<br><br>crosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much<br><br>as anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old<br><br>Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the<br><br>thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those<br><br>wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so<br><br>much to the great strength of the masonry.<br><br><br><br>But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not<br><br>enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and<br><br>woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side<br><br>the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with<br><br>them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the<br><br>confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to<br><br>a point.  Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to<br><br>do it.<br><br><br><br>Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the<br><br>graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease<br><br>undulates through a Titanism of power.  On the contrary, those<br><br>motions derive their most appalling beauty from it.  Real strength<br><br>never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in<br><br>everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the<br><br>magic.  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from<br><br>the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone.  As<br><br>devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of<br><br>Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that<br><br>seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.  When Angelo paints even God the<br><br>Father in human form, mark what robustness is there.  And whatever<br><br>they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,<br><br>hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most<br><br>successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of<br><br>all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative,<br><br>feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is<br><br>conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.<br><br><br><br>Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether<br><br>wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it<br><br>be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.<br><br>Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.<br><br><br><br>Five great motions are peculiar to it.  First, when used as a fin for<br><br>progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in<br><br>sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.<br><br><br><br>First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in<br><br>a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It<br><br>never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.<br><br>To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise<br><br>coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,<br><br>it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the<br><br>monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer<br><br>by.<br><br><br><br>Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only<br><br>fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in<br><br>his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.<br><br>In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and<br><br>the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the<br><br>unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is<br><br>then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.<br><br>Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways<br><br>through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy<br><br>of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked<br><br>rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is<br><br>generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so<br><br>often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's<br><br>play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.<br><br><br><br>Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale<br><br>the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect<br><br>there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the<br><br>elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of<br><br>sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft<br><br>slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of<br><br>the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,<br><br>whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary<br><br>touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway<br><br>bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the<br><br>flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to<br><br>damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a<br><br>pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in<br><br>his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded<br><br>in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.<br><br><br><br>Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of<br><br>the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast<br><br>corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as<br><br>if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The<br><br>broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting<br><br>the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would<br><br>almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the<br><br>light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you<br><br>would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.<br><br><br><br>Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the<br><br>flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then<br><br>completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to<br><br>plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of<br><br>his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a<br><br>moment, till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime<br><br>BREACH--somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's<br><br>flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated<br><br>nature.  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems<br><br>spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I<br><br>seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from<br><br>the flame Baltic of Hell.  But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in<br><br>all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to<br><br>you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head<br><br>of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a<br><br>large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and<br><br>for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed<br><br>to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods<br><br>was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.<br><br>As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then<br><br>testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all<br><br>beings.  For according to King Juba, the military elephants of<br><br>antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the<br><br>profoundest silence.<br><br><br><br>The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the<br><br>elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk<br><br>of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two<br><br>opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they<br><br>respectively belong.  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier<br><br>to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but<br><br>the stalk of a lily.  The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk<br><br>were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush<br><br>and crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated<br><br>instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their<br><br>oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses<br><br>his balls.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale<br><br>and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the<br><br>elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does<br><br>to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of<br><br>curious similitude; among these is the spout.  It is well known that<br><br>the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then<br><br>elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my<br><br>inability to express it.  At times there are gestures in it, which,<br><br>though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly<br><br>inexplicable.  In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are<br><br>these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared<br><br>them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by<br><br>these methods intelligently conversed with the world.  Nor are there<br><br>wanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of<br><br>strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.<br><br>Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not,<br><br>and never will.  But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how<br><br>understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he<br><br>has none?  Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say,<br><br>but my face shall not be seen.  But I cannot completely make out his<br><br>back parts; and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has<br><br>no face.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 87<br><br><br><br>The Grand Armada.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward<br><br>from the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all<br><br>Asia.  In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long<br><br>islands of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others,<br><br>form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with<br><br>Australia, and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the<br><br>thickly studded oriental archipelagoes.  This rampart is pierced by<br><br>several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales;<br><br>conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca.  By the<br><br>straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west,<br><br>emerge into the China seas.<br><br><br><br>Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing<br><br>midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green<br><br>promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little<br><br>correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled<br><br>empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and<br><br>silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand<br><br>islands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant<br><br>provision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of<br><br>the land, should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual,<br><br>of being guarded from the all-grasping western world.  The shores of<br><br>the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses<br><br>which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the<br><br>Propontis.  Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the<br><br>obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of<br><br>ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day,<br><br>have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with<br><br>the costliest cargoes of the east.  But while they freely waive a<br><br>ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to<br><br>more solid tribute.<br><br><br><br>Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the<br><br>low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the<br><br>vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at<br><br>the point of their spears.  Though by the repeated bloody<br><br>chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers,<br><br>the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed;<br><br>yet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and<br><br>American vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly<br><br>boarded and pillaged.<br><br><br><br>With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these<br><br>straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and<br><br>thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here<br><br>and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine<br><br>Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great<br><br>whaling season there.  By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod<br><br>would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the<br><br>world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where<br><br>Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted<br><br>upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to<br><br>frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed<br><br>to be haunting it.<br><br><br><br>But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his<br><br>crew drink air?  Surely, he will stop for water.  Nay.  For a long<br><br>time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring,<br><br>and needs no sustenance but what's in himself.  So Ahab.  Mark this,<br><br>too, in the whaler.  While other hulls are loaded down with alien<br><br>stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering<br><br>whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and<br><br>their wants.  She has a whole lake's contents bottled in her ample<br><br>hold.  She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable<br><br>pig-lead and kentledge.  She carries years' water in her.  Clear old<br><br>prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the<br><br>Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish<br><br>fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian<br><br>streams.  Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China<br><br>from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the<br><br>whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of<br><br>soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like<br><br>themselves.  So that did you carry them the news that another flood<br><br>had come; they would only answer--"Well, boys, here's the ark!"<br><br><br><br>Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of<br><br>Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most<br><br>of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen<br><br>as an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained<br><br>more and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed,<br><br>and admonished to keep wide awake.  But though the green palmy cliffs<br><br>of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted<br><br>nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single<br><br>jet was descried.  Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with<br><br>any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when<br><br>the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a<br><br>spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.<br><br><br><br>But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with<br><br>which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm<br><br>Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached<br><br>companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in<br><br>extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it<br><br>would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn<br><br>league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection.  To this<br><br>aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be<br><br>imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you<br><br>may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being<br><br>greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what<br><br>sometimes seems thousands on thousands.<br><br><br><br>Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and<br><br>forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,<br><br>a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the<br><br>noon-day air.  Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the<br><br>Right Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like<br><br>the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting<br><br>spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist,<br><br>continually rising and falling away to leeward.<br><br><br><br>Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill<br><br>of the sea, this host of vapoury spouts, individually curling up into<br><br>the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze,<br><br>showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis,<br><br>descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.<br><br><br><br>As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,<br><br>accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage<br><br>in their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the<br><br>plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying<br><br>forward through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their<br><br>semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic<br><br>centre.<br><br><br><br>Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers<br><br>handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their<br><br>yet suspended boats.  If the wind only held, little doubt had they,<br><br>that chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only<br><br>deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of<br><br>their number.  And who could tell whether, in that congregated<br><br>caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like<br><br>the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the<br><br>Siamese!  So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along,<br><br>driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of<br><br>Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our<br><br>wake.<br><br><br><br>Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our<br><br>rear.  It seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling<br><br>something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so<br><br>completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally<br><br>disappearing.  Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly<br><br>revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, "Aloft there, and rig whips and<br><br>buckets to wet the sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!"<br><br><br><br>As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should<br><br>fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in<br><br>hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay.  But when the<br><br>swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase;<br><br>how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding<br><br>her on to her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to<br><br>her, that they were.  As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced<br><br>the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and<br><br>in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such<br><br>fancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced upon the green<br><br>walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and<br><br>bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance,<br><br>and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing<br><br>and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of<br><br>remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were<br><br>infernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all these<br><br>conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and<br><br>ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been<br><br>gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.<br><br><br><br>But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and<br><br>when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the<br><br>Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra<br><br>side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the<br><br>harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been<br><br>gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so<br><br>victoriously gained upon the Malays.  But still driving on in the<br><br>wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed;<br><br>gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was<br><br>passed to spring to the boats.  But no sooner did the herd, by some<br><br>presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of<br><br>the three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their<br><br>rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and<br><br>battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of<br><br>stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.<br><br><br><br>Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and<br><br>after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the<br><br>chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave<br><br>animating token that they were now at last under the influence of<br><br>that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the<br><br>fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The<br><br>compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and<br><br>steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and<br><br>like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they<br><br>seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in<br><br>vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by<br><br>their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction<br><br>of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their<br><br>number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like<br><br>water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been<br><br>but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce<br><br>wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.<br><br>But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding<br><br>creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the<br><br>lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary<br><br>horseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together<br><br>in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest<br><br>alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,<br><br>trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.<br><br>Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied<br><br>whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth<br><br>which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.<br><br><br><br>Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,<br><br>yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced<br><br>nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is<br><br>customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making<br><br>for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about<br><br>three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish<br><br>darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like<br><br>light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a<br><br>movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is<br><br>in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less<br><br>anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous<br><br>vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you<br><br>deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to<br><br>circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.<br><br><br><br>As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power<br><br>of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;<br><br>as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we<br><br>flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset<br><br>boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving<br><br>to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at<br><br>what moment it may be locked in and crushed.<br><br><br><br>But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off<br><br>from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging<br><br>away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while<br><br>all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking<br><br>out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for<br><br>there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite<br><br>idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.<br><br>They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  "Out of<br><br>the way, Commodore!" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden<br><br>rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp<br><br>us.  "Hard down with your tail, there!" cried a second to another,<br><br>which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his<br><br>own fan-like extremity.<br><br><br><br>All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally<br><br>invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares<br><br>of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they<br><br>cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable<br><br>length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other<br><br>end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a<br><br>harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.<br><br>For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly<br><br>chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;<br><br>while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot<br><br>kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be<br><br>afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like<br><br>these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with<br><br>three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we<br><br>saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous<br><br>sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like<br><br>malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in<br><br>the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under<br><br>one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and<br><br>carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the<br><br>seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the<br><br>wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,<br><br>and so stopped the leaks for the time.<br><br><br><br>It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were<br><br>it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly<br><br>diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from<br><br>the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.<br><br>So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing<br><br>whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting<br><br>momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of<br><br>the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene<br><br>valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the<br><br>outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse<br><br>the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,<br><br>produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more<br><br>quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say<br><br>lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted<br><br>distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and<br><br>saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going<br><br>round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so<br><br>closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might<br><br>easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on<br><br>their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,<br><br>more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no<br><br>possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch<br><br>for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had<br><br>only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of<br><br>the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;<br><br>the women and children of this routed host.<br><br><br><br>Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving<br><br>outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods<br><br>in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,<br><br>embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or<br><br>three square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a<br><br>time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low<br><br>boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I<br><br>mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had<br><br>been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide<br><br>extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the<br><br>precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,<br><br>unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it<br><br>may have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our<br><br>becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous<br><br>fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it<br><br>was impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came<br><br>snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till<br><br>it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.<br><br>Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with<br><br>his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained<br><br>from darting it.<br><br><br><br>But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and<br><br>still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,<br><br>suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing<br><br>mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed<br><br>shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a<br><br>considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants<br><br>while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as<br><br>if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing<br><br>mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly<br><br>reminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up<br><br>towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in<br><br>their new-born sight.  Floating on their sides, the mothers also<br><br>seemed quietly eyeing us.  One of these little infants, that from<br><br>certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured<br><br>some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.  He was a<br><br>little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered<br><br>from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal<br><br>reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring,<br><br>the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow.  The delicate<br><br>side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the<br><br>plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from<br><br>foreign parts.<br><br><br><br>"Line! line!" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; "him fast!<br><br>him fast!--Who line him!  Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one<br><br>little!"<br><br><br><br>"What ails ye, man?" cried Starbuck.<br><br><br><br>"Look-e here," said Queequeg, pointing down.<br><br><br><br>As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds<br><br>of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and<br><br>shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling<br><br>towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical<br><br>cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still<br><br>tethered to its dam.  Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the<br><br>chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes<br><br>entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped.<br><br>Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in<br><br>this enchanted pond.  We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but<br><br>unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a<br><br>gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing<br><br>but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to<br><br>an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two<br><br>teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the<br><br>breasts themselves extend upwards from that.  When by chance these<br><br>precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the<br><br>mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for<br><br>rods.  The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it<br><br>might do well with strawberries.  When overflowing with mutual<br><br>esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.<br><br><br><br><br><br>And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations<br><br>and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely<br><br>and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely<br><br>revelled in dalliance and delight.  But even so, amid the tornadoed<br><br>Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in<br><br>mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round<br><br>me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal<br><br>mildness of joy.<br><br><br><br>Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic<br><br>spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,<br><br>still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or<br><br>possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance<br><br>of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them.  But the<br><br>sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to<br><br>and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes.<br><br>It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly<br><br>powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by<br><br>sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon.  It is done by darting<br><br>a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for<br><br>hauling it back again.  A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in<br><br>this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from<br><br>the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in<br><br>the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the<br><br>revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the<br><br>battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.<br><br><br><br>But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling<br><br>spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he<br><br>seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at<br><br>first the intervening distance obscured from us.  But at length we<br><br>perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,<br><br>this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he<br><br>had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free<br><br>end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in<br><br>the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade<br><br>itself had worked loose from his flesh.  So that tormented to<br><br>madness, he was now churning through the water, violently flailing<br><br>with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,<br><br>wounding and murdering his own comrades.<br><br><br><br>This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their<br><br>stationary fright.  First, the whales forming the margin of our lake<br><br>began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted<br><br>by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly<br><br>to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries<br><br>vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more<br><br>central circles began to swim in thickening clusters.  Yes, the long<br><br>calm was departing.  A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then<br><br>like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river<br><br>Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling<br><br>upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common<br><br>mountain.  Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck<br><br>taking the stern.<br><br><br><br>"Oars!  Oars!" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--"gripe your<br><br>oars, and clutch your souls, now!  My God, men, stand by!  Shove him<br><br>off, you Queequeg--the whale there!--prick him!--hit him!  Stand<br><br>up--stand up, and stay so!  Spring, men--pull, men; never mind their<br><br>backs--scrape them!--scrape away!"<br><br><br><br>The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving<br><br>a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths.  But by desperate<br><br>endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way<br><br>rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.<br><br>After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided<br><br>into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by<br><br>random whales, all violently making for one centre.  This lucky<br><br>salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who,<br><br>while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat<br><br>taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing<br><br>of a pair of broad flukes close by.<br><br><br><br>Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon<br><br>resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having<br><br>clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their<br><br>onward flight with augmented fleetness.  Further pursuit was useless;<br><br>but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged<br><br>whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which<br><br>Flask had killed and waifed.  The waif is a pennoned pole, two or<br><br>three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional<br><br>game is at hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a<br><br>dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of<br><br>prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.<br><br><br><br>The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that<br><br>sagacious saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish.  Of<br><br>all the drugged whales only one was captured.  The rest contrived to<br><br>escape for the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen,<br><br>by some other craft than the Pequod.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 88<br><br><br><br>Schools and Schoolmasters.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm<br><br>Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing<br><br>those vast aggregations.<br><br><br><br>Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must<br><br>have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are<br><br>occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals<br><br>each.  Such bands are known as schools.  They generally are of two<br><br>sorts; those composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering<br><br>none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly<br><br>designated.<br><br><br><br>In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see<br><br>a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm,<br><br>evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight<br><br>of his ladies.  In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman,<br><br>swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by<br><br>all the solaces and endearments of the harem.  The contrast between<br><br>this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he is<br><br>always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at<br><br>full growth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an<br><br>average-sized male.  They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare<br><br>say, not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist.  Nevertheless,<br><br>it cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily<br><br>entitled to EMBONPOINT.<br><br><br><br>It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent<br><br>ramblings.  Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in<br><br>leisurely search of variety.  You meet them on the Line in time for<br><br>the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just<br><br>returned, perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and<br><br>so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth.  By the<br><br>time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator<br><br>awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the<br><br>cool season there, and so evade the other excessive temperature of<br><br>the year.<br><br><br><br>When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange<br><br>suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his<br><br>interesting family.  Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan<br><br>coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the<br><br>ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases<br><br>him away!  High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him<br><br>are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though<br><br>do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario<br><br>out of his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common.  As ashore, the<br><br>ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival<br><br>admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly<br><br>battle, and all for love.  They fence with their long lower jaws,<br><br>sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy<br><br>like elks that warringly interweave their antlers.  Not a few are<br><br>captured having the deep scars of these encounters,--furrowed heads,<br><br>broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and<br><br>dislocated mouths.<br><br><br><br>But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at<br><br>the first rush of the harem's lord, then is it very diverting to<br><br>watch that lord.  Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again<br><br>and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young<br><br>Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand<br><br>concubines.  Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen<br><br>will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand<br><br>Turks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their unctuousness<br><br>is small.  As for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons<br><br>and daughters must take care of themselves; at least, with only the<br><br>maternal help.  For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that<br><br>might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however<br><br>much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his<br><br>anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic.  In good<br><br>time, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and<br><br>dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a<br><br>general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and<br><br>virtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the<br><br>impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands<br><br>the harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all<br><br>alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and<br><br>warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors.<br><br><br><br>Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so<br><br>is the lord and master of that school technically known as the<br><br>schoolmaster.  It is therefore not in strict character, however<br><br>admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should<br><br>then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly<br><br>of it.  His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived<br><br>from the name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised<br><br>that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must<br><br>have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a<br><br>country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days,<br><br>and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into<br><br>some of his pupils.<br><br><br><br>The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale<br><br>betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm<br><br>Whales.  Almost universally, a lone whale--as a solitary Leviathan is<br><br>called--proves an ancient one.  Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel<br><br>Boone, he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he<br><br>takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she<br><br>is, though she keeps so many moody secrets.<br><br><br><br>The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously<br><br>mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools.  For while<br><br>those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or<br><br>forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious<br><br>of all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;<br><br>excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,<br><br>and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal<br><br>gout.<br><br><br><br>The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools.<br><br>Like a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and<br><br>wickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking<br><br>rate, that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he<br><br>would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard.  They soon relinquish this<br><br>turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and<br><br>separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems.<br><br><br><br>Another point of difference between the male and female schools is<br><br>still more characteristic of the sexes.  Say you strike a<br><br>Forty-barrel-bull--poor devil! all his comrades quit him.  But strike<br><br>a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with<br><br>every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long,<br><br>as themselves to fall a prey.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 89<br><br><br><br>Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,<br><br>necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale<br><br>fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.<br><br><br><br>It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in<br><br>company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be<br><br>finally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are<br><br>indirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this<br><br>one grand feature.  For example,--after a weary and perilous chase<br><br>and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by<br><br>reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be<br><br>retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside,<br><br>without risk of life or line.  Thus the most vexatious and violent<br><br>disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not some<br><br>written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all<br><br>cases.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative<br><br>enactment, was that of Holland.  It was decreed by the States-General<br><br>in A.D. 1695.  But though no other nation has ever had any written<br><br>whaling law, yet the American fishermen have been their own<br><br>legislators and lawyers in this matter.  They have provided a system<br><br>which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and<br><br>the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling<br><br>with other People's Business.  Yes; these laws might be engraven on a<br><br>Queen Anne's forthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the<br><br>neck, so small are they.<br><br><br><br>I.  A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.<br><br><br><br>II.  A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.<br><br><br><br>But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable<br><br>brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to<br><br>expound it.<br><br><br><br>First: What is a Fast-Fish?  Alive or dead a fish is technically<br><br>fast, when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any<br><br>medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants,--a mast, an<br><br>oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it<br><br>is all the same.  Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a<br><br>waif, or any other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the<br><br>party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it<br><br>alongside, as well as their intention so to do.<br><br><br><br>These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the<br><br>whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder<br><br>knocks--the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist.  True, among the more<br><br>upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for<br><br>peculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for<br><br>one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed<br><br>by another party.  But others are by no means so scrupulous.<br><br><br><br>Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover<br><br>litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a<br><br>hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the<br><br>plaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last,<br><br>through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their<br><br>lines, but their boat itself.  Ultimately the defendants (the crew of<br><br>another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and<br><br>finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs.  And<br><br>when those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped<br><br>his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth, and assured them that by way of<br><br>doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line,<br><br>harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the whale at the<br><br>time of the seizure.  Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the<br><br>recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.<br><br><br><br>Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the<br><br>judge.  In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to<br><br>illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,<br><br>wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's<br><br>viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in<br><br>the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action<br><br>to recover possession of her.  Erskine was on the other side; and he<br><br>then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally<br><br>harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of<br><br>the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned<br><br>her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and<br><br>therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then<br><br>became that subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever<br><br>harpoon might have been found sticking in her.<br><br><br><br>Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the<br><br>whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.<br><br><br><br>These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the<br><br>very learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the<br><br>boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely<br><br>abandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the<br><br>controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the<br><br>defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the<br><br>final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made<br><br>off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles;<br><br>and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them.<br><br>Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid<br><br>articles were theirs.<br><br><br><br>A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge,<br><br>might possibly object to it.  But ploughed up to the primary rock of<br><br>the matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling<br><br>laws previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord<br><br>Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching<br><br>Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the<br><br>fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its<br><br>complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the<br><br>Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.<br><br><br><br>Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the<br><br>law: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession?  But<br><br>often possession is the whole of the law.  What are the sinews and<br><br>souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof<br><br>possession is the whole of the law?  What to the rapacious landlord<br><br>is the widow's last mite but a Fast-Fish?

What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the<br><br>broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to<br><br>keep Woebegone's family from starvation; what is that ruinous<br><br>discount but a Fast-Fish?  What is the Archbishop of Savesoul's<br><br>income of L100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of<br><br>hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven<br><br>without any of Savesoul's help) what is that globular L100,000 but a<br><br>Fast-Fish?

And concerning all<br><br>these, is not Possession the whole of the law?<br><br><br><br>But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the<br><br>kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so.

A<br><br>division which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is<br><br>no intermediate remainder.  Now as this law, under a modified form,<br><br>is to this day in force in England; and as it offers in various<br><br>respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and<br><br>Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same<br><br>courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the<br><br>expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the accommodation<br><br>of royalty.  In the first place, in curious proof of the fact that<br><br>the above-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay before<br><br>you a circumstance that happened within the last two years.<br><br><br><br>It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one<br><br>of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and<br><br>beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off<br><br>from the shore.  Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under<br><br>the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord<br><br>Warden.  Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all<br><br>the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become<br><br>by assignment his.  By some writers this office is called a sinecure.<br><br>But not so.  Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in<br><br>fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same<br><br>fobbing of them.<br><br><br><br>Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their<br><br>trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their<br><br>fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good L150 from the<br><br>precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their<br><br>wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their<br><br>respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and<br><br>charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and<br><br>laying it upon the whale's head, he says--"Hands off! this fish, my<br><br>masters, is a Fast-Fish.  I seize it as the Lord Warden's."  Upon<br><br>this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation--so truly<br><br>English--knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their<br><br>heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the<br><br>stranger.  But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften<br><br>the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone.<br><br>At length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas,<br><br>made bold to speak,<br><br><br><br>"Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?"<br><br><br><br>"The Duke."<br><br><br><br>"But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?"<br><br><br><br>"It is his."<br><br><br><br>"We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is<br><br>all that to go to the Duke's benefit; we getting nothing at all for<br><br>our pains but our blisters?"<br><br><br><br>"It is his."<br><br><br><br>"Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of<br><br>getting a livelihood?"<br><br><br><br>"It is his."<br><br><br><br>"I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of<br><br>this whale."<br><br><br><br>"It is his."<br><br><br><br>"Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?"<br><br><br><br>"It is his."<br><br><br><br>In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of<br><br>Wellington received the money.  Thinking that viewed in some<br><br>particular lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small<br><br>degree be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an<br><br>honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his<br><br>Grace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners<br><br>into full consideration.  To which my Lord Duke in substance replied<br><br>(both letters were published) that he had already done so, and<br><br>received the money, and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if<br><br>for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would decline meddling<br><br>with other people's business.  Is this the still militant old man,<br><br>standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands coercing<br><br>alms of beggars?<br><br><br><br>It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the<br><br>Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign.  We must<br><br>needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally<br><br>invested with that right.  The law itself has already been set forth.<br><br>But Plowdon gives us the reason for it.  Says Plowdon, the whale so<br><br>caught belongs to the King and Queen, "because of its superior<br><br>excellence."  And by the soundest commentators this has ever been<br><br>held a cogent argument in such matters.<br><br><br><br>But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail?  A<br><br>reason for that, ye lawyers!<br><br><br><br>In his treatise on "Queen-Gold," or Queen-pinmoney, an old King's<br><br>Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: "Ye tail is ye<br><br>Queen's, that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone."<br><br>Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the<br><br>Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies' bodices.  But<br><br>this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad<br><br>mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne.  But is the Queen a<br><br>mermaid, to be presented with a tail?  An allegorical meaning may<br><br>lurk here.<br><br><br><br>There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers--the<br><br>whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain<br><br>limitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's<br><br>ordinary revenue.  I know not that any other author has hinted of the<br><br>matter; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be<br><br>divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the highly<br><br>dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically<br><br>regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed<br><br>congeniality.

BROWNE, V.E.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when<br><br>we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the<br><br>many noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than<br><br>the three pairs of eyes aloft.  A peculiar and not very pleasant<br><br>smell was smelt in the sea.<br><br><br><br>"I will bet something now," said Stubb, "that somewhere hereabouts<br><br>are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day.  I thought<br><br>they would keel up before long."<br><br><br><br>Presently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the<br><br>distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of<br><br>whale must be alongside.  As we glided nearer, the stranger showed<br><br>French colours from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture<br><br>sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was<br><br>plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a<br><br>blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea,<br><br>and so floated an unappropriated corpse.  It may well be conceived,<br><br>what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian<br><br>city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the<br><br>departed.  So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no<br><br>cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.  Yet are there<br><br>those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil<br><br>obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no<br><br>means of the nature of attar-of-rose.<br><br><br><br>Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the<br><br>Frenchman had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed<br><br>even more of a nosegay than the first.  In truth, it turned out to be<br><br>one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a<br><br>sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct<br><br>bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.  Nevertheless,<br><br>in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever<br><br>turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun<br><br>blasted whales in general.<br><br><br><br>The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he<br><br>recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were<br><br>knotted round the tail of one of these whales.<br><br><br><br>"There's a pretty fellow, now," he banteringly laughed, standing in<br><br>the ship's bows, "there's a jackal for ye!  I well know that these<br><br>Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes<br><br>lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale<br><br>spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold<br><br>full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing<br><br>that all the oil they will get won't be enough to dip the Captain's<br><br>wick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here's a<br><br>Crappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I<br><br>mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that<br><br>other precious fish he has there.  Poor devil!  I say, pass round a<br><br>hat, some one, and let's make him a present of a little oil for dear<br><br>charity's sake.  For what oil he'll get from that drugged whale<br><br>there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned<br><br>cell.  And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get more oil by<br><br>chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he'll get<br><br>from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may<br><br>contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris.  I<br><br>wonder now if our old man has thought of that.  It's worth trying.<br><br>Yes, I'm for it;" and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.<br><br><br><br>By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that<br><br>whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with<br><br>no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again.  Issuing from<br><br>the cabin, Stubb now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the<br><br>stranger.  Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance<br><br>with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was<br><br>carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green,<br><br>and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there;<br><br>the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red<br><br>colour.  Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read "Bouton<br><br>de Rose,"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name<br><br>of this aromatic ship.<br><br><br><br>Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription,<br><br>yet the word ROSE, and the bulbous figure-head put together,<br><br>sufficiently explained the whole to him.<br><br><br><br>"A wooden rose-bud, eh?" he cried with his hand to his nose, "that<br><br>will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!"<br><br><br><br>Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he<br><br>had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close<br><br>to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.<br><br><br><br>Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he<br><br>bawled--"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses<br><br>that speak English?"<br><br><br><br>"Yes," rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to<br><br>be the chief-mate.<br><br><br><br>"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?"<br><br><br><br>"WHAT whale?"<br><br><br><br>"The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?<br><br><br><br>"Never heard of such a whale.  Cachalot Blanche!  White Whale--no."<br><br><br><br>"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute."<br><br><br><br>Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning<br><br>over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two<br><br>hands into a trumpet and shouted--"No, Sir!  No!"  Upon which Ahab<br><br>retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.<br><br><br><br>He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the<br><br>chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort<br><br>of bag.<br><br><br><br>"What's the matter with your nose, there?" said Stubb.  "Broke it?"<br><br><br><br>"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!"<br><br>answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was<br><br>at very much.  "But what are you holding YOURS for?"<br><br><br><br>"Oh, nothing!  It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on.  Fine day,<br><br>ain't it?  Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of<br><br>posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?"<br><br><br><br>"What in the devil's name do you want here?" roared the Guernseyman,<br><br>flying into a sudden passion.<br><br><br><br>"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those<br><br>whales in ice while you're working at 'em?  But joking aside, though;<br><br>do you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil<br><br>out of such whales?  As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a<br><br>gill in his whole carcase."<br><br><br><br>"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't<br><br>believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer<br><br>before.  But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't<br><br>me; and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape."<br><br><br><br>"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow," rejoined<br><br>Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.  There a queer<br><br>scene presented itself.  The sailors, in tasselled caps of red<br><br>worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.<br><br>But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in<br><br>anything but a good humor.  All their noses upwardly projected from<br><br>their faces like so many jib-booms.  Now and then pairs of them would<br><br>drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.<br><br>Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,<br><br>and at intervals held it to their nostrils.  Others having broken the<br><br>stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously<br><br>puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their<br><br>olfactories.<br><br><br><br>Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding<br><br>from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction<br><br>saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar<br><br>from within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain<br><br>remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself<br><br>to the Captain's round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the<br><br>pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and<br><br>indignations at times.<br><br><br><br>Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to<br><br>the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the<br><br>stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited<br><br>ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable<br><br>a pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the<br><br>Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the<br><br>ambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise<br><br>was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly<br><br>concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the<br><br>Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.<br><br>According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under<br><br>cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he<br><br>pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter<br><br>any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.<br><br><br><br>By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.  He was a<br><br>small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,<br><br>with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton<br><br>velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb<br><br>was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once<br><br>ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.<br><br><br><br>"What shall I say to him first?" said he.<br><br><br><br>"Why," said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,<br><br>"you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish<br><br>to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge."<br><br><br><br>"He says, Monsieur," said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his<br><br>captain, "that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain<br><br>and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from<br><br>a blasted whale they had brought alongside."<br><br><br><br>Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.<br><br><br><br>"What now?" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.<br><br><br><br>"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him<br><br>carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a<br><br>whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.  In fact, tell him from me he's a<br><br>baboon."<br><br><br><br>"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,<br><br>is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he<br><br>conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish."<br><br><br><br>Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his<br><br>crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast<br><br>loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.<br><br><br><br>"What now?" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to<br><br>them.<br><br><br><br>"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in<br><br>fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps<br><br>somebody else."<br><br><br><br>"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service<br><br>to us."<br><br><br><br>Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties<br><br>(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down<br><br>into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.<br><br><br><br>"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him," said the<br><br>interpreter.<br><br><br><br>"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink<br><br>with the man I've diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go."<br><br><br><br>"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking;<br><br>but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then<br><br>Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from<br><br>these whales, for it's so calm they won't drift."<br><br><br><br>By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,<br><br>hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line<br><br>in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out<br><br>the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.  While the<br><br>Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,<br><br>Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,<br><br>ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.<br><br><br><br>Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the<br><br>whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,<br><br>while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.  Whereupon<br><br>Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to<br><br>give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of<br><br>his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced<br><br>an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would<br><br>almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and<br><br>when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like<br><br>turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.<br><br>His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their<br><br>chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.<br><br><br><br>And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and<br><br>screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was<br><br>beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay<br><br>increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,<br><br>there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide<br><br>of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow<br><br>into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for<br><br>a time.<br><br><br><br>"I have it, I have it," cried Stubb, with delight, striking something<br><br>in the subterranean regions, "a purse! a purse!"<br><br><br><br>Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of<br><br>something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old<br><br>cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it<br><br>with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And<br><br>this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any<br><br>druggist.  Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably<br><br>lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured<br><br>were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and<br><br>come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 92<br><br><br><br>Ambergris.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as<br><br>an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain<br><br>Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on<br><br>that subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively<br><br>late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber<br><br>itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but<br><br>the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite<br><br>distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also<br><br>dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found<br><br>except upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,<br><br>odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and<br><br>ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and<br><br>spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious<br><br>candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and<br><br>also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is<br><br>carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few<br><br>grains into claret, to flavor it.<br><br><br><br>Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should<br><br>regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a<br><br>sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the<br><br>cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How<br><br>to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering<br><br>three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out<br><br>of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.<br><br><br><br>I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,<br><br>certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might<br><br>be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they<br><br>were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that<br><br>manner.<br><br><br><br>Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be<br><br>found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of<br><br>that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and<br><br>incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.<br><br>And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is<br><br>that maketh the best musk.  Also forget not the strange fact that of<br><br>all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental<br><br>manufacturing stages, is the worst.<br><br><br><br>I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but<br><br>cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against<br><br>whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,<br><br>might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said<br><br>of the Frenchman's two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the<br><br>slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling<br><br>is throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another<br><br>thing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how<br><br>did this odious stigma originate?<br><br><br><br>I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the<br><br>Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.<br><br>Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their<br><br>oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the<br><br>fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of<br><br>large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the<br><br>season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which<br><br>they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,<br><br>that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale<br><br>cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat<br><br>similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for<br><br>the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.<br><br><br><br>I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be<br><br>likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in<br><br>former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,<br><br>which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in<br><br>his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name<br><br>imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in<br><br>order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to<br><br>be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.<br><br>It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when<br><br>the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very<br><br>pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea<br><br>Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after<br><br>completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume<br><br>fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it<br><br>is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or<br><br>dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means<br><br>creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people<br><br>of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the<br><br>nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,<br><br>when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking<br><br>abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,<br><br>seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's<br><br>flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady<br><br>rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the<br><br>Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not<br><br>be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with<br><br>myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexander<br><br>the Great?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 93<br><br><br><br>The Castaway.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a<br><br>most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's<br><br>crew; an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the<br><br>sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever<br><br>accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her<br><br>own.<br><br><br><br>Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.<br><br>Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is<br><br>to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale.  As a<br><br>general thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men<br><br>comprising the boats' crews.  But if there happen to be an unduly<br><br>slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain<br><br>to be made a ship-keeper.  It was so in the Pequod with the little<br><br>negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation.  Poor Pip! ye have<br><br>heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic<br><br>midnight, so gloomy-jolly.<br><br><br><br>In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony<br><br>and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour,<br><br>driven in one eccentric span.  But while hapless Dough-Boy was by<br><br>nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over<br><br>tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant,<br><br>genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever<br><br>enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any<br><br>other race.  For blacks, the year's calendar should show naught but<br><br>three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year's Days.<br><br>Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for<br><br>even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,<br><br>panelled in king's cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life's<br><br>peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he<br><br>had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred<br><br>his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus<br><br>temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly<br><br>illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to<br><br>ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County<br><br>in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the<br><br>green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the<br><br>round horizon into one star-belled tambourine.  So, though in the<br><br>clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the<br><br>pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning<br><br>jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he<br><br>lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the<br><br>sun, but by some unnatural gases.  Then come out those fiery<br><br>effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once<br><br>the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel<br><br>stolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.<br><br><br><br>It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman<br><br>chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;<br><br>and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.<br><br><br><br>The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;<br><br>but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and<br><br>therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb<br><br>observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his<br><br>courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.<br><br><br><br>Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as<br><br>the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which<br><br>happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The<br><br>involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in<br><br>hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack<br><br>whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with<br><br>him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the<br><br>water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the<br><br>line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up<br><br>to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,<br><br>which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.<br><br><br><br>Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He<br><br>hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,<br><br>he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,<br><br>exclaimed interrogatively, "Cut?"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face<br><br>plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less<br><br>than half a minute, this entire thing happened.<br><br><br><br>"Damn him, cut!" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was<br><br>saved.<br><br><br><br>So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed<br><br>by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these<br><br>irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,<br><br>business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;<br><br>and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The<br><br>substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest<br><br>was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,<br><br>STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will<br><br>sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,<br><br>as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted<br><br>conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a<br><br>margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,<br><br>and concluded with a peremptory command, "Stick to the boat, Pip, or<br><br>by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't<br><br>afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for<br><br>thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and<br><br>don't jump any more."  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that<br><br>though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which<br><br>propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.<br><br><br><br>But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It<br><br>was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but<br><br>this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale<br><br>started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried<br><br>traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It<br><br>was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and<br><br>cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like<br><br>gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and<br><br>down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No<br><br>boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb's<br><br>inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In<br><br>three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and<br><br>Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,<br><br>curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the<br><br>loftiest and the brightest.<br><br><br><br>Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the<br><br>practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the<br><br>awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self<br><br>in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?<br><br>Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark<br><br>how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.<br><br><br><br>But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?<br><br>No; he did not mean to, at least.  Because there were two boats in<br><br>his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come<br><br>up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such<br><br>considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own<br><br>timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar<br><br>instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost<br><br>invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the<br><br>same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.<br><br><br><br>But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly<br><br>spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and<br><br>Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent<br><br>upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him<br><br>miserably.  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;<br><br>but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;<br><br>such, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept his<br><br>finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.  Not drowned<br><br>entirely, though.  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths,<br><br>where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro<br><br>before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his<br><br>hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile<br><br>eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral<br><br>insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal<br><br>orbs.  He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;<br><br>and therefore his shipmates called him mad.  So man's insanity is<br><br>heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at<br><br>last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and<br><br>frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as<br><br>his God.<br><br><br><br>For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly.  The thing is common in<br><br>that fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be<br><br>seen what like abandonment befell myself.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 94<br><br><br><br>A Squeeze of the Hand.<br><br><br><br><br><br>That whale of Stubb's, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the<br><br>Pequod's side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations<br><br>previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling<br><br>of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.<br><br><br><br>While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed<br><br>in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm;<br><br>and when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully<br><br>manipulated ere going to the try-works, of which anon.<br><br><br><br>It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with<br><br>several others, I sat down before a large Constantine's bath of it, I<br><br>found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about<br><br>in the liquid part.  It was our business to squeeze these lumps back<br><br>into fluid.  A sweet and unctuous duty!  No wonder that in old times<br><br>this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic.  Such a clearer! such a<br><br>sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious molifier!  After<br><br>having my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like<br><br>eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine and spiralise.<br><br><br><br>As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter<br><br>exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under<br><br>indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands<br><br>among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven<br><br>almost within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and<br><br>discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as<br><br>I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,--literally and truly, like<br><br>the smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I<br><br>lived as in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in<br><br>that inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I<br><br>almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is<br><br>of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that<br><br>bath, I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or petulance, or<br><br>malice, of any sort whatsoever.<br><br><br><br>Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that<br><br>sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till<br><br>a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself<br><br>unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their<br><br>hands for the gentle globules.  Such an abounding, affectionate,<br><br>friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was<br><br>continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes<br><br>sentimentally; as much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why<br><br>should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest<br><br>ill-humor or envy!  Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us<br><br>all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves<br><br>universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.<br><br><br><br>Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever!  For now,<br><br>since by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that<br><br>in all cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his<br><br>conceit of attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the<br><br>intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the<br><br>table, the saddle, the fireside, the country; now that I have<br><br>perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally.  In<br><br>thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in<br><br>paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.<br><br><br><br>Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things<br><br>akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the<br><br>try-works.<br><br><br><br>First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the<br><br>tapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his<br><br>flukes.  It is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but<br><br>still contains some oil.  After being severed from the whale, the<br><br>white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the<br><br>mincer.  They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.<br><br><br><br>Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of<br><br>the whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber,<br><br>and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness.<br><br>It is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold.  As<br><br>its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a<br><br>bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest<br><br>crimson and purple.  It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron.<br><br>Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it.  I<br><br>confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it.  It tasted<br><br>something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis<br><br>le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed the<br><br>first day after the venison season, and that particular venison<br><br>season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards<br><br>of Champagne.<br><br><br><br>There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up<br><br>in the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very<br><br>puzzling adequately to describe.  It is called slobgollion; an<br><br>appellation original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of<br><br>the substance.  It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most<br><br>frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing,<br><br>and subsequent decanting.  I hold it to be the wondrously thin,<br><br>ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.<br><br><br><br>Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but<br><br>sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen.  It designates<br><br>the dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the<br><br>Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those<br><br>inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.<br><br><br><br>Nippers.  Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's<br><br>vocabulary.  But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so.  A whaleman's<br><br>nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering<br><br>part of Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for<br><br>the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe.  Edgewise<br><br>moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and<br><br>by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all<br><br>impurities.<br><br><br><br>But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at<br><br>once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its<br><br>inmates.  This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle<br><br>for the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale.  When<br><br>the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment<br><br>is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night.  On one side,<br><br>lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen.<br><br>They generally go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man.<br><br>The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the<br><br>same name.  The gaff is something like a boat-hook.  With his gaff,<br><br>the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it<br><br>from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about.  Meanwhile, the<br><br>spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it<br><br>into the portable horse-pieces.  This spade is sharp as hone can make<br><br>it; the spademan's feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will<br><br>sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.  If he<br><br>cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be<br><br>very much astonished?  Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room<br><br>men.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 95<br><br><br><br>The Cassock.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this<br><br>post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the<br><br>windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small<br><br>curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have<br><br>seen there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers.  Not the<br><br>wondrous cistern in the whale's huge head; not the prodigy of his<br><br>unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of<br><br>these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable<br><br>cone,--longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at<br><br>the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg.  And an<br><br>idol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was.<br><br>Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in<br><br>Judea; and for worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her,<br><br>and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook<br><br>Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of<br><br>Kings.<br><br><br><br>Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and<br><br>assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the<br><br>mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as<br><br>if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field.<br><br>Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically<br><br>to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa.<br><br>This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives<br><br>it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at<br><br>last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry.  Ere long, it is<br><br>taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed<br><br>extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end,<br><br>he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it.  The mincer now stands<br><br>before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.<br><br>Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately<br><br>protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.<br><br><br><br>That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the<br><br>pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,<br><br>planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub<br><br>beneath it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets<br><br>from a rapt orator's desk.  Arrayed in decent black; occupying a<br><br>conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an<br><br>archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*Bible leaves!  Bible leaves!  This is the invariable cry from the<br><br>mates to the mincer.  It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work<br><br>into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business<br><br>of boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity<br><br>considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 96<br><br><br><br>The Try-Works.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly<br><br>distinguished by her try-works.  She presents the curious anomaly of<br><br>the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the<br><br>completed ship.  It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were<br><br>transported to her planks.<br><br><br><br>The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the<br><br>most roomy part of the deck.  The timbers beneath are of a peculiar<br><br>strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of<br><br>brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height.<br><br>The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly<br><br>secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all<br><br>sides, and screwing it down to the timbers.  On the flanks it is<br><br>cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping,<br><br>battened hatchway.  Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots,<br><br>two in number, and each of several barrels' capacity.  When not in<br><br>use, they are kept remarkably clean.  Sometimes they are polished<br><br>with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver<br><br>punch-bowls.  During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will<br><br>crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap.  While<br><br>employed in polishing them--one man in each pot, side by side--many<br><br>confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips.  It<br><br>is a place also for profound mathematical meditation.  It was in the<br><br>left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently<br><br>circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the<br><br>remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the<br><br>cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in<br><br>precisely the same time.<br><br><br><br>Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare<br><br>masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of<br><br>the furnaces, directly underneath the pots.  These mouths are fitted<br><br>with heavy doors of iron.  The intense heat of the fire is prevented<br><br>from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow<br><br>reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works.<br><br>By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished<br><br>with water as fast as it evaporates.  There are no external chimneys;<br><br>they open direct from the rear wall.  And here let us go back for a<br><br>moment.<br><br><br><br>It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod's try-works were<br><br>first started on this present voyage.  It belonged to Stubb to<br><br>oversee the business.<br><br><br><br>"All ready there?  Off hatch, then, and start her.  You cook, fire<br><br>the works."  This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been<br><br>thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage.  Here<br><br>be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has<br><br>to be fed for a time with wood.  After that no wood is used, except<br><br>as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel.  In a word, after<br><br>being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or<br><br>fritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties.<br><br>These fritters feed the flames.  Like a plethoric burning martyr, or<br><br>a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his<br><br>own fuel and burns by his own body.  Would that he consumed his own<br><br>smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must,<br><br>and not only that, but you must live in it for the time.  It has an<br><br>unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the<br><br>vicinity of funereal pyres.  It smells like the left wing of the day<br><br>of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.<br><br><br><br>By midnight the works were in full operation.  We were clear from the<br><br>carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean<br><br>darkness was intense.  But that darkness was licked up by the fierce<br><br>flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and<br><br>illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek<br><br>fire.  The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to<br><br>some vengeful deed.  So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the<br><br>bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with<br><br>broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates,<br><br>and folded them in conflagrations.<br><br><br><br>The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide<br><br>hearth in front of them.  Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes<br><br>of the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship's stokers.  With huge<br><br>pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the<br><br>scalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames<br><br>darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet.  The<br><br>smoke rolled away in sullen heaps.  To every pitch of the ship there<br><br>was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap<br><br>into their faces.  Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further<br><br>side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass.  This served for a<br><br>sea-sofa.  Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,<br><br>looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched<br><br>in their heads.  Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke<br><br>and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric<br><br>brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the<br><br>capricious emblazonings of the works.  As they narrated to each other<br><br>their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of<br><br>mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like<br><br>the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the<br><br>harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and<br><br>dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship<br><br>groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and<br><br>further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully<br><br>champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on<br><br>all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden<br><br>with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of<br><br>darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac<br><br>commander's soul.<br><br><br><br>So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours<br><br>silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea.  Wrapped, for<br><br>that interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness,<br><br>the madness, the ghastliness of others.  The continual sight of the<br><br>fiend shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire,<br><br>these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to<br><br>yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me<br><br>at a midnight helm.<br><br><br><br>But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since<br><br>inexplicable) thing occurred to me.  Starting from a brief standing<br><br>sleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong.  The<br><br>jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears<br><br>was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I<br><br>thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers<br><br>to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart.<br><br>But, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to steer by;<br><br>though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card, by<br><br>the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it.  Nothing seemed before me<br><br>but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness.<br><br>Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I<br><br>stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all<br><br>havens astern.  A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over<br><br>me.  Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy<br><br>conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,<br><br>inverted.  My God! what is the matter with me? thought I.  Lo! in my<br><br>brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship's<br><br>stern, with my back to her prow and the compass.  In an instant I<br><br>faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into<br><br>the wind, and very probably capsizing her.  How glad and how grateful<br><br>the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the<br><br>fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!<br><br><br><br>Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man!  Never dream with<br><br>thy hand on the helm!  Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the<br><br>first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire,<br><br>when its redness makes all things look ghastly.  To-morrow, in the<br><br>natural sun, the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils<br><br>in the forking flames, the morn will show in far other, at least<br><br>gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true<br><br>lamp--all others but liars!<br><br><br><br>Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's<br><br>accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of<br><br>deserts and of griefs beneath the moon.  The sun hides not the ocean,<br><br>which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this<br><br>earth.  So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than<br><br>sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true--not true, or<br><br>undeveloped.  With books the same.  The truest of all men was the Man<br><br>of Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon's, and<br><br>Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe.  "All is vanity."<br><br>ALL.  This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon's<br><br>wisdom yet.  But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks fast<br><br>crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell;<br><br>calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men;<br><br>and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing<br><br>wise, and therefore jolly;--not that man is fitted to sit down on<br><br>tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably<br><br>wondrous Solomon.<br><br><br><br>But even Solomon, he says, "the man that wandereth out of the way of<br><br>understanding shall remain" (I.E., even while living) "in the<br><br>congregation of the dead."  Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest<br><br>it invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me.  There is a<br><br>wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness.  And there is<br><br>a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the<br><br>blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in<br><br>the sunny spaces.  And even if he for ever flies within the gorge,<br><br>that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the<br><br>mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even<br><br>though they soar.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 97<br><br><br><br>The Lamp.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Had you descended from the Pequod's try-works to the Pequod's<br><br>forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single<br><br>moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some<br><br>illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors.  There they<br><br>lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled<br><br>muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.<br><br><br><br>In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of<br><br>queens.  To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in<br><br>darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot.  But the whaleman, as<br><br>he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light.  He makes his berth<br><br>an Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest<br><br>night the ship's black hull still houses an illumination.<br><br><br><br>See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of<br><br>lamps--often but old bottles and vials, though--to the copper cooler<br><br>at the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a<br><br>vat.  He burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and,<br><br>therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or<br><br>astral contrivances ashore.  It is sweet as early grass butter in<br><br>April.  He goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its<br><br>freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts<br><br>up his own supper of game.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 98<br><br><br><br>Stowing Down and Clearing Up.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off<br><br>descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,<br><br>and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed<br><br>alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the<br><br>headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his<br><br>great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in<br><br>due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach,<br><br>and Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through<br><br>the fire;--but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this<br><br>part of the description by rehearsing--singing, if I may--the<br><br>romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and<br><br>striking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan returns<br><br>to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as<br><br>before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.<br><br><br><br>While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the<br><br>six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and<br><br>rolling this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are<br><br>slewed round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously<br><br>scoot across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at<br><br>last man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops,<br><br>rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX<br><br>OFFICIO, every sailor is a cooper.<br><br><br><br>At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the<br><br>great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,<br><br>and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea.

One day the planks stream<br><br>with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous<br><br>masses of the whale's head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie<br><br>about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has<br><br>besooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with<br><br>unctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on<br><br>all hands the din is deafening.<br><br><br><br>But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in<br><br>this self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and<br><br>try-works, you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant<br><br>vessel, with a most scrupulously neat commander.  The unmanufactured<br><br>sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue.  This is the<br><br>reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call<br><br>an affair of oil.  Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of<br><br>the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any<br><br>adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side,<br><br>that lye quickly exterminates it.  Hands go diligently along the<br><br>bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their<br><br>full tidiness.  The soot is brushed from the lower rigging.  All the<br><br>numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully<br><br>cleansed and put away.  The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon<br><br>the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of<br><br>sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the<br><br>combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's<br><br>company, the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded,<br><br>then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift<br><br>themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck,<br><br>fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest<br><br>Holland.<br><br><br><br>Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and<br><br>humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;<br><br>propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object<br><br>not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle.  To<br><br>hint to such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were<br><br>little short of audacity.  They know not the thing you distantly<br><br>allude to.  Away, and bring us napkins!<br><br><br><br>But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men<br><br>intent on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will<br><br>again soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small<br><br>grease-spot somewhere.  Yes; and many is the time, when, after the<br><br>severest uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing<br><br>straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they<br><br>have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,--they only<br><br>step to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass,<br><br>and cut and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and<br><br>burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the<br><br>equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they have<br><br>finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless<br><br>dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning<br><br>the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of "There<br><br>she blows!" and away they fly to fight another whale, and go through<br><br>the whole weary thing again.  Oh! my friends, but this is<br><br>man-killing!  Yet this is life.  For hardly have we mortals by long<br><br>toilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but<br><br>valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves<br><br>from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles<br><br>of the soul; hardly is this done, when--THERE SHE BLOWS!--the ghost<br><br>is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go<br><br>through young life's old routine again.<br><br><br><br>Oh! the metempsychosis!  Oh!  Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two<br><br>thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with<br><br>thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am,<br><br>taught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 99<br><br><br><br>The Doubloon.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his<br><br>quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and<br><br>mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration<br><br>it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most<br><br>plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and<br><br>stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him.  When<br><br>he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the<br><br>pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with<br><br>the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he<br><br>again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance<br><br>fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same<br><br>aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing,<br><br>if not hopefulness.<br><br><br><br>But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly<br><br>attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as<br><br>though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in<br><br>some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them.  And<br><br>some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are<br><br>little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except<br><br>to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up<br><br>some morass in the Milky Way.<br><br><br><br>Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of<br><br>the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden<br><br>sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows.  And though now<br><br>nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of<br><br>copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it<br><br>still preserved its Quito glow.  Nor, though placed amongst a<br><br>ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through<br><br>the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover<br><br>any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon<br><br>where the sunset left it last.  For it was set apart and sanctified<br><br>to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one<br><br>and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale's talisman.<br><br>Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering<br><br>whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend<br><br>it.<br><br><br><br>Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the<br><br>sun and tropic token-pieces.  Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes;<br><br>sun's disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners<br><br>waving, are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold<br><br>seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories,<br><br>by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.<br><br><br><br>It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy<br><br>example of these things.  On its round border it bore the letters,<br><br>REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO.  So this bright coin came from a<br><br>country planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great<br><br>equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up the<br><br>Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn.  Zoned by those<br><br>letters you saw the likeness of three Andes' summits; from one a<br><br>flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching<br><br>over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all<br><br>marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering<br><br>the equinoctial point at Libra.<br><br><br><br>Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now<br><br>pausing.<br><br><br><br>"There's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and<br><br>all other grand and lofty things; look here,--three peaks as proud as<br><br>Lucifer.  The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab;<br><br>the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is<br><br>Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the<br><br>rounder globe, which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man<br><br>in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self.  Great pains, small<br><br>gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve<br><br>itself.  Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see!<br><br>aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months<br><br>before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries!  From storm to<br><br>storm!  So be it, then.  Born in throes, 't is fit that man should<br><br>live in pains and die in pangs!  So be it, then!  Here's stout stuff<br><br>for woe to work on.  So be it, then."<br><br><br><br>"No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's claws must have<br><br>left their mouldings there since yesterday," murmured Starbuck to<br><br>himself, leaning against the bulwarks.  "The old man seems to read<br><br>Belshazzar's awful writing.  I have never marked the coin<br><br>inspectingly.  He goes below; let me read.  A dark valley between<br><br>three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in<br><br>some faint earthly symbol.  So in this vale of Death, God girds us<br><br>round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines<br><br>a beacon and a hope.  If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows<br><br>her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance<br><br>half way, to cheer.  Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at<br><br>midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze<br><br>for him in vain!  This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still<br><br>sadly to me.  I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely."<br><br><br><br>"There now's the old Mogul," soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,<br><br>"he's been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and<br><br>both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine<br><br>fathoms long.  And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I<br><br>have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer's Hook, I'd not look at it<br><br>very long ere spending it.  Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion,<br><br>I regard this as queer.  I have seen doubloons before now in my<br><br>voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your<br><br>doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of<br><br>Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and<br><br>half joes, and quarter joes.  What then should there be in this<br><br>doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful?  By Golconda!<br><br>let me read it once.  Halloa! here's signs and wonders truly!  That,<br><br>now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what<br><br>my almanac below calls ditto.  I'll get the almanac and as I have<br><br>heard devils can be raised with Daboll's arithmetic, I'll try my hand<br><br>at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the<br><br>Massachusetts calendar.  Here's the book.  Let's see now.  Signs and<br><br>wonders; and the sun, he's always among 'em.  Hem, hem, hem; here<br><br>they are--here they go--all alive:--Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the<br><br>Bull and Jimimi! here's Gemini himself, or the Twins.  Well; the sun<br><br>he wheels among 'em.  Aye, here on the coin he's just crossing the<br><br>threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.  Book!<br><br>you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places.  You'll<br><br>do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the<br><br>thoughts.  That's my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts<br><br>calendar, and Bowditch's navigator, and Daboll's arithmetic go.<br><br>Signs and wonders, eh?  Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs,<br><br>and significant in wonders!  There's a clue somewhere; wait a bit;<br><br>hist--hark!  By Jove, I have it!  Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac<br><br>here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I'll read it<br><br>off, straight out of the book.  Come, Almanack!  To begin: there's<br><br>Aries, or the Ram--lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the<br><br>Bull--he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins--that<br><br>is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer<br><br>the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a<br><br>roaring Lion, lies in the path--he gives a few fierce bites and surly<br><br>dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that's our<br><br>first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes<br><br>Libra, or the Scales--happiness weighed and found wanting; and while<br><br>we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio,<br><br>or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when<br><br>whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is<br><br>amusing himself.  As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here's<br><br>the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes<br><br>rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the<br><br>Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind<br><br>up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep.  There's a sermon now, writ<br><br>in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes<br><br>out of it all alive and hearty.  Jollily he, aloft there, wheels<br><br>through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb.  Oh,<br><br>jolly's the word for aye!  Adieu, Doubloon!  But stop; here comes<br><br>little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let's hear what<br><br>he'll have to say.  There; he's before it; he'll out with something<br><br>presently.  So, so; he's beginning."<br><br><br><br>"I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever<br><br>raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him.  So, what's<br><br>all this staring been about?  It is worth sixteen dollars, that's<br><br>true; and at two cents the cigar, that's nine hundred and sixty<br><br>cigars.  I won't smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and<br><br>here's nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to<br><br>spy 'em out."<br><br><br><br>"Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has<br><br>a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a<br><br>sort of wiseish look to it.  But, avast; here comes our old<br><br>Manxman--the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he<br><br>took to the sea.  He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes<br><br>round on the other side of the mast; why, there's a horse-shoe nailed<br><br>on that side; and now he's back again; what does that mean?  Hark!<br><br>he's muttering--voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill.  Prick ears,<br><br>and listen!"<br><br><br><br>"If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when<br><br>the sun stands in some one of these signs.  I've studied signs, and<br><br>know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old<br><br>witch in Copenhagen.  Now, in what sign will the sun then be?  The<br><br>horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold.  And<br><br>what's the horse-shoe sign?  The lion is the horse-shoe sign--the<br><br>roaring and devouring lion.  Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to<br><br>think of thee."<br><br><br><br>"There's another rendering now; but still one text.  All sorts of men<br><br>in one kind of world, you see.  Dodge again! here comes Queequeg--all<br><br>tattooing--looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself.  What says the<br><br>Cannibal?  As I live he's comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;<br><br>thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I<br><br>suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon's Astronomy in the back<br><br>country.  And by Jove, he's found something there in the vicinity of<br><br>his thigh--I guess it's Sagittarius, or the Archer.  No: he don't<br><br>know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off<br><br>some king's trowsers.  But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,<br><br>Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his<br><br>pumps as usual.  What does he say, with that look of his?  Ah, only<br><br>makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the<br><br>coin--fire worshipper, depend upon it.  Ho! more and more.  This way<br><br>comes Pip--poor boy! would he had died, or I; he's half horrible to<br><br>me.  He too has been watching all of these interpreters--myself<br><br>included--and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot<br><br>face.  Stand away again and hear him.  Hark!"<br><br><br><br>"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."<br><br><br><br>"Upon my soul, he's been studying Murray's Grammar!  Improving his<br><br>mind, poor fellow!  But what's that he says now--hist!"<br><br><br><br>"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."<br><br><br><br>"Why, he's getting it by heart--hist! again."<br><br><br><br>"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."<br><br><br><br>"Well, that's funny."<br><br><br><br>"And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I'm a<br><br>crow, especially when I stand a'top of this pine tree here.  Caw!<br><br>caw! caw! caw! caw! caw!  Ain't I a crow?  And where's the<br><br>scare-crow?  There he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old<br><br>trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket."<br><br><br><br>"Wonder if he means me?--complimentary!--poor lad!--I could go hang<br><br>myself.  Any way, for the present, I'll quit Pip's vicinity.  I can<br><br>stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he's too crazy-witty<br><br>for my sanity.  So, so, I leave him muttering."<br><br><br><br>"Here's the ship's navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on<br><br>fire to unscrew it.  But, unscrew your navel, and what's the<br><br>consequence?  Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for<br><br>when aught's nailed to the mast it's a sign that things grow<br><br>desperate.  Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he'll nail ye!  This<br><br>is a pine tree.  My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine<br><br>tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old<br><br>darkey's wedding ring.  How did it get there?  And so they'll say in<br><br>the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find a<br><br>doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark.  Oh,<br><br>the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser'll hoard ye<br><br>soon!  Hish! hish!  God goes 'mong the worlds blackberrying.  Cook!<br><br>ho, cook! and cook us!  Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny!<br><br>and get your hoe-cake done!"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 100<br><br><br><br>Leg and Arm.<br><br><br><br>The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Ship, ahoy!  Hast seen the White Whale?"<br><br><br><br>So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,<br><br>bearing down under the stern.  Trumpet to mouth, the old man was<br><br>standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed<br><br>to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own<br><br>boat's bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,<br><br>fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious<br><br>roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and<br><br>one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered<br><br>arm of a hussar's surcoat.<br><br><br><br>"Hast seen the White Whale!"<br><br><br><br>"See you this?" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden<br><br>it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a<br><br>wooden head like a mallet.<br><br><br><br>"Man my boat!" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars<br><br>near him--"Stand by to lower!"<br><br><br><br>In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his<br><br>crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the<br><br>stranger.  But here a curious difficulty presented itself.  In the<br><br>excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of<br><br>his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but<br><br>his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy<br><br>mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be<br><br>rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.  Now,<br><br>it is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost<br><br>hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a<br><br>boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up<br><br>towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down<br><br>to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of<br><br>course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab<br><br>now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;<br><br>hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope<br><br>to attain.<br><br><br><br>It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward<br><br>circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his<br><br>luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.<br><br>And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of<br><br>the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the<br><br>perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him<br><br>a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not<br><br>seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a<br><br>cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only<br><br>lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance<br><br>how affairs stood, cried out, "I see, I see!--avast heaving there!<br><br>Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle."<br><br><br><br>As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or<br><br>two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive<br><br>curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the<br><br>end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it<br><br>all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like<br><br>sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),<br><br>and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time<br><br>also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon<br><br>one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung<br><br>inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.<br><br>With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain<br><br>advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory<br><br>arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, "Aye,<br><br>aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm<br><br>that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where<br><br>did'st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?"<br><br><br><br>"The White Whale," said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm<br><br>towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had<br><br>been a telescope; "there I saw him, on the Line, last season."<br><br><br><br>"And he took that arm off, did he?" asked Ahab, now sliding down from<br><br>the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he did so.<br><br><br><br>"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?"<br><br><br><br>"Spin me the yarn," said Ahab; "how was it?"<br><br><br><br>"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,"<br><br>began the Englishman.  "I was ignorant of the White Whale at that<br><br>time.  Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and<br><br>my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,<br><br>that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could<br><br>only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.<br><br>Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great<br><br>whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows' feet and<br><br>wrinkles."<br><br><br><br>"It was he, it was he!" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his<br><br>suspended breath.<br><br><br><br>"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin."<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons," cried Ahab, exultingly--"but<br><br>on!"<br><br><br><br>"Give me a chance, then," said the Englishman, good-humoredly.<br><br>"Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs<br><br>all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my<br><br>fast-line!<br><br><br><br>"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I<br><br>know him."<br><br><br><br>"How it was exactly," continued the one-armed commander, "I do not<br><br>know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there<br><br>somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards<br><br>pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of<br><br>the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing<br><br>how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest<br><br>and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,<br><br>spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the<br><br>hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to<br><br>might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a<br><br>whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's<br><br>boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;<br><br>Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's<br><br>boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and<br><br>snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.<br><br>But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next<br><br>instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged<br><br>and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight up<br><br>out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use<br><br>sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding<br><br>sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second<br><br>iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,<br><br>cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes<br><br>first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all<br><br>chips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I<br><br>seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment<br><br>clung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,<br><br>and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,<br><br>went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron<br><br>towing along near me caught me here" (clapping his hand just below<br><br>his shoulder); "yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to<br><br>Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the<br><br>good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--clear along the<br><br>whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I<br><br>floated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the<br><br>way, captain--Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger, my lad,--the<br><br>captain).  Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn."<br><br><br><br>The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all<br><br>the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote<br><br>his gentlemanly rank on board.  His face was an exceedingly round but<br><br>sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and<br><br>patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention<br><br>between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in<br><br>the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs<br><br>of the two crippled captains.  But, at his superior's introduction of<br><br>him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his<br><br>captain's bidding.<br><br><br><br>"It was a shocking bad wound," began the whale-surgeon; "and, taking<br><br>my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy--"<br><br><br><br>"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship," interrupted the one-armed<br><br>captain, addressing Ahab; "go on, boy."<br><br><br><br>"Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing<br><br>hot weather there on the Line.  But it was no use--I did all I could;<br><br>sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of<br><br>diet--"<br><br><br><br>"Oh, very severe!" chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly<br><br>altering his voice, "Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night,<br><br>till he couldn't see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed,<br><br>half seas over, about three o'clock in the morning.  Oh, ye stars! he<br><br>sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet.  Oh! a great<br><br>watcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you<br><br>dog, laugh out! why don't ye?  You know you're a precious jolly<br><br>rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I'd rather be killed by you than kept<br><br>alive by any other man."<br><br><br><br>"My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir"--said<br><br>the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab--"is<br><br>apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that<br><br>sort.  But I may as well say--en passant, as the French remark--that<br><br>I myself--that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend<br><br>clergy--am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink--"<br><br><br><br>"Water!" cried the captain; "he never drinks it; it's a sort of fits<br><br>to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on--go on<br><br>with the arm story."<br><br><br><br>"Yes, I may as well," said the surgeon, coolly.  "I was about<br><br>observing, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that<br><br>spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse<br><br>and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon<br><br>ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long.  I measured it<br><br>with the lead line.  In short, it grew black; I knew what was<br><br>threatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand in shipping that<br><br>ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule"--pointing at it with<br><br>the marlingspike--"that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered<br><br>the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the<br><br>end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine<br><br>once.  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.  Do ye see this<br><br>dent, sir"--removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and<br><br>exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the<br><br>slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a<br><br>wound--"Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here;<br><br>he knows."<br><br><br><br>"No, I don't," said the captain, "but his mother did; he was born<br><br>with it.  Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger! was there ever such<br><br>another Bunger in the watery world?  Bunger, when you die, you ought<br><br>to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages,<br><br>you rascal."<br><br><br><br>"What became of the White Whale?" now cried Ahab, who thus far had<br><br>been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two<br><br>Englishmen.<br><br><br><br>"Oh!" cried the one-armed captain, "oh, yes!  Well; after he sounded,<br><br>we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I<br><br>didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,<br><br>till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard<br><br>about Moby Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he."<br><br><br><br>"Did'st thou cross his wake again?"<br><br><br><br>"Twice."<br><br><br><br>"But could not fasten?"<br><br><br><br>"Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough?  What should I do<br><br>without this other arm?  And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so<br><br>much as he swallows."<br><br><br><br>"Well, then," interrupted Bunger, "give him your left arm for bait to<br><br>get the right.  Do you know, gentlemen"--very gravely and<br><br>mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession--"Do you know,<br><br>gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably<br><br>constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him<br><br>to completely digest even a man's arm?  And he knows it too.  So that<br><br>what you take for the White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness.<br><br>For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to<br><br>terrify by feints.  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,<br><br>formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow<br><br>jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest,<br><br>and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an<br><br>emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d'ye see.  No possible<br><br>way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into<br><br>his general bodily system.  Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick<br><br>enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the<br><br>privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case<br><br>the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you<br><br>shortly, that's all."<br><br><br><br>"No, thank ye, Bunger," said the English Captain, "he's welcome to<br><br>the arm he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know him then; but<br><br>not to another one.  No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for<br><br>him once, and that has satisfied me.  There would be great glory in<br><br>killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm<br><br>in him, but, hark ye, he's best let alone; don't you think so,<br><br>Captain?"--glancing at the ivory leg.<br><br><br><br>"He is.  But he will still be hunted, for all that.  What is best let<br><br>alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures.  He's<br><br>all a magnet!  How long since thou saw'st him last?  Which way<br><br>heading?"<br><br><br><br>"Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend's," cried Bunger, stoopingly<br><br>walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; "this man's<br><br>blood--bring the thermometer!--it's at the boiling point!--his pulse<br><br>makes these planks beat!--sir!"--taking a lancet from his pocket, and<br><br>drawing near to Ahab's arm.<br><br><br><br>"Avast!" roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks--"Man the<br><br>boat!  Which way heading?"<br><br><br><br>"Good God!" cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.<br><br>"What's the matter?  He was heading east, I think.--Is your Captain<br><br>crazy?" whispering Fedallah.<br><br><br><br>But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to<br><br>take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle<br><br>towards him, commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.<br><br><br><br>In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the Manilla men<br><br>were springing to their oars.  In vain the English Captain hailed<br><br>him.  With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to<br><br>his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 101<br><br><br><br>The Decanter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she<br><br>hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,<br><br>merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of<br><br>Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion, comes<br><br>not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in<br><br>point of real historical interest.  How long, prior to the year of<br><br>our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous<br><br>fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted<br><br>out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm<br><br>Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our<br><br>valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large<br><br>fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South<br><br>Atlantic: not elsewhere.  Be it distinctly recorded here, that the<br><br>Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized<br><br>steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were<br><br>the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.<br><br><br><br>In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,<br><br>and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape<br><br>Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of<br><br>any sort in the great South Sea.  The voyage was a skilful and lucky<br><br>one; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious<br><br>sperm, the Amelia's example was soon followed by other ships, English<br><br>and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific<br><br>were thrown open.  But not content with this good deed, the<br><br>indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his<br><br>Sons--how many, their mother only knows--and under their immediate<br><br>auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British<br><br>government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling<br><br>voyage of discovery into the South Sea.  Commanded by a naval<br><br>Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some<br><br>service; how much does not appear.  But this is not all.  In 1819,<br><br>the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to go<br><br>on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.  That ship--well<br><br>called the "Syren"--made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus<br><br>that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.<br><br>The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a<br><br>Nantucketer.<br><br><br><br>All honour to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists<br><br>to the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long<br><br>ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other<br><br>world.<br><br><br><br>The ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast<br><br>sailer and a noble craft every way.  I boarded her once at midnight<br><br>somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the<br><br>forecastle.  It was a fine gam we had, and they were all<br><br>trumps--every soul on board.  A short life to them, and a jolly<br><br>death.  And that fine gam I had--long, very long after old Ahab<br><br>touched her planks with his ivory heel--it minds me of the noble,<br><br>solid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me,<br><br>and the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it.  Flip?  Did I<br><br>say we had flip?  Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons<br><br>the hour; and when the squall came (for it's squally off there by<br><br>Patagonia), and all hands--visitors and all--were called to reef<br><br>topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft<br><br>in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into<br><br>the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a<br><br>warning example to all drunken tars.  However, the masts did not go<br><br>overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to<br><br>pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the<br><br>forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my<br><br>taste.<br><br><br><br>The beef was fine--tough, but with body in it.  They said it was<br><br>bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for<br><br>certain, how that was.  They had dumplings too; small, but<br><br>substantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings.  I<br><br>fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after<br><br>they were swallowed.  If you stooped over too far forward, you risked<br><br>their pitching out of you like billiard-balls.  The bread--but that<br><br>couldn't be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the<br><br>bread contained the only fresh fare they had.  But the forecastle was<br><br>not very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner<br><br>when you ate it.  But all in all, taking her from truck to helm,<br><br>considering the dimensions of the cook's boilers, including his own<br><br>live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a<br><br>jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack<br><br>fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.<br><br><br><br>But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other<br><br>English whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous,<br><br>hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the<br><br>can, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking,<br><br>and laughing?  I will tell you.  The abounding good cheer of these<br><br>English whalers is matter for historical research.  Nor have I been<br><br>at all sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed<br><br>needed.<br><br><br><br>The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,<br><br>Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant<br><br>in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,<br><br>touching plenty to eat and drink.  For, as a general thing, the<br><br>English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English<br><br>whaler.  Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is<br><br>not normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and,<br><br>therefore, must have some special origin, which is here pointed out,<br><br>and will be still further elucidated.<br><br><br><br>During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an<br><br>ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew<br><br>must be about whalers.  The title was, "Dan Coopman," wherefore I<br><br>concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam<br><br>cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper.  I<br><br>was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production<br><br>of one "Fitz Swackhammer."  But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very<br><br>learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of<br><br>Santa Claus and St. Pott's, to whom I handed the work for<br><br>translation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble--this<br><br>same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured me that "Dan<br><br>Coopman" did not mean "The Cooper," but "The Merchant."  In short,<br><br>this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of<br><br>Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very interesting<br><br>account of its whale fishery.  And in this chapter it was, headed,<br><br>"Smeer," or "Fat," that I found a long detailed list of the outfits<br><br>for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which<br><br>list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:<br><br><br><br>400,000 lbs. of beef.<br><br>60,000 lbs. Friesland pork.<br><br>150,000 lbs. of stock fish.<br><br>550,000 lbs. of biscuit.<br><br>72,000 lbs. of soft bread.<br><br>2,800 firkins of butter.<br><br>20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese.<br><br>144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article).<br><br>550 ankers of Geneva.<br><br>10,800 barrels of beer.<br><br><br><br>Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in<br><br>the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole<br><br>pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.<br><br><br><br>At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all<br><br>this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were<br><br>incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and<br><br>Platonic application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary<br><br>tables of my own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc.,<br><br>consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and<br><br>Spitzbergen whale fishery.  In the first place, the amount of butter,<br><br>and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing.  I impute it,<br><br>though, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still<br><br>more unctuous by the nature of their vocation, and especially by<br><br>their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very<br><br>coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge<br><br>each other in bumpers of train oil.<br><br><br><br>The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels.  Now,<br><br>as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer<br><br>of that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch<br><br>whalemen, including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea,<br><br>did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each<br><br>of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all;<br><br>therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for<br><br>a twelve weeks' allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that<br><br>550 ankers of gin.  Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so<br><br>fuddled as one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of<br><br>men to stand up in a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales;<br><br>this would seem somewhat improbable.  Yet they did aim at them, and<br><br>hit them too.  But this was very far North, be it remembered, where<br><br>beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the Equator, in our<br><br>southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at<br><br>the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to<br><br>Nantucket and New Bedford.<br><br><br><br>But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers<br><br>of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English<br><br>whalers have not neglected so excellent an example.  For, say they,<br><br>when cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of<br><br>the world, get a good dinner out of it, at least.  And this empties<br><br>the decanter.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 102<br><br><br><br>A Bower in the Arsacides.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have<br><br>chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and<br><br>in detail upon some few interior structural features.  But to a large<br><br>and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to<br><br>unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose,<br><br>unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of<br><br>the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his<br><br>ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.<br><br><br><br>But how now, Ishmael?  How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the<br><br>fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the<br><br>whale?  Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver<br><br>lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass,<br><br>hold up a specimen rib for exhibition?  Explain thyself, Ishmael.<br><br>Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a<br><br>cook dishes a roast-pig?  Surely not.  A veritable witness have you<br><br>hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege<br><br>of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and<br><br>beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making<br><br>up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,<br><br>dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.<br><br><br><br>I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far<br><br>beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been<br><br>blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature.  In a ship I<br><br>belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the<br><br>deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the<br><br>harpoons, and for the heads of the lances.  Think you I let that<br><br>chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking<br><br>the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub?<br><br><br><br>And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their<br><br>gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am<br><br>indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of<br><br>the Arsacides.  For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the<br><br>trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the<br><br>Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm<br><br>villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our<br><br>sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.<br><br><br><br>Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being<br><br>gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had<br><br>brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious<br><br>of his people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful<br><br>devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic<br><br>canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the<br><br>wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.<br><br><br><br>Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an<br><br>unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with<br><br>his head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted<br><br>droopings seemed his verdant jet.  When the vast body had at last<br><br>been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become<br><br>dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully transported up<br><br>the Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered<br><br>it.<br><br><br><br>The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with<br><br>Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the<br><br>priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic<br><br>head again sent forth its vapoury spout; while, suspended from a<br><br>bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like<br><br>the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.<br><br><br><br>It was a wondrous sight.  The wood was green as mosses of the Icy<br><br>Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the<br><br>industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom, with a gorgeous<br><br>carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and<br><br>woof, and the living flowers the figures.  All the trees, with all<br><br>their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the<br><br>message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active.  Through the<br><br>lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving<br><br>the unwearied verdure.  Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one<br><br>word!--whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore<br><br>all these ceaseless toilings?  Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--but<br><br>one single word with thee!  Nay--the shuttle flies--the figures float<br><br>from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides<br><br>away.  The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened,<br><br>that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look<br><br>on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear<br><br>the thousand voices that speak through it.  For even so it is in all<br><br>material factories.  The spoken words that are inaudible among the<br><br>flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the<br><br>walls, bursting from the opened casements.  Thereby have villainies<br><br>been detected.  Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all this din<br><br>of the great world's loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard<br><br>afar.<br><br><br><br>Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the<br><br>great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging--a gigantic idler!<br><br>Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed<br><br>around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all<br><br>woven over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher<br><br>verdure; but himself a skeleton.  Life folded Death; Death trellised<br><br>Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him<br><br>curly-headed glories.<br><br><br><br>Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw<br><br>the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the<br><br>real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel<br><br>as an object of vertu.  He laughed.  But more I marvelled that the<br><br>priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine.  To and fro I<br><br>paced before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through<br><br>the ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long<br><br>amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours.  But soon my<br><br>line was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I<br><br>entered.  I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.<br><br><br><br>Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the<br><br>skeleton.  From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived<br><br>me taking the altitude of the final rib, "How now!" they shouted;<br><br>"Dar'st thou measure this our god!  That's for us."  "Aye,<br><br>priests--well, how long do ye make him, then?"  But hereupon a fierce<br><br>contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked<br><br>each other's sconces with their yard-sticks--the great skull<br><br>echoed--and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own<br><br>admeasurements.<br><br><br><br>These admeasurements I now propose to set before you.  But first, be<br><br>it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied<br><br>measurement I please.  Because there are skeleton authorities you<br><br>can refer to, to test my accuracy.  There is a Leviathanic Museum,<br><br>they tell me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that<br><br>country, where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other<br><br>whales.  Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in<br><br>New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call "the only perfect<br><br>specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States."<br><br>Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name,<br><br>a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton<br><br>of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown<br><br>magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's.<br><br><br><br>In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons<br><br>belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar<br><br>grounds.  King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir<br><br>Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts.  Sir<br><br>Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a<br><br>great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony<br><br>cavities--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--and swing all day<br><br>upon his lower jaw.  Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors<br><br>and shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a<br><br>bunch of keys at his side.  Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence<br><br>for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence<br><br>to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for<br><br>the unrivalled view from his forehead.<br><br><br><br>The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied<br><br>verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild<br><br>wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of<br><br>preserving such valuable statistics.  But as I was crowded for space,<br><br>and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a<br><br>poem I was then composing--at least, what untattooed parts might<br><br>remain--I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed,<br><br>should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the<br><br>whale.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 103<br><br><br><br>Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton.<br><br><br><br><br><br>In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain<br><br>statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton<br><br>we are briefly to exhibit.  Such a statement may prove useful here.<br><br><br><br>According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly<br><br>base upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the<br><br>largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to<br><br>my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest<br><br>magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and<br><br>something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a<br><br>whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen<br><br>men to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population<br><br>of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants.<br><br><br><br>Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to<br><br>this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's<br><br>imagination?<br><br><br><br>Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,<br><br>jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now<br><br>simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his<br><br>unobstructed bones.  But as the colossal skull embraces so very large<br><br>a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far<br><br>the most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated<br><br>concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your<br><br>mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a<br><br>complete notion of the general structure we are about to view.<br><br><br><br>In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two<br><br>Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have<br><br>been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one<br><br>fifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two<br><br>feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some<br><br>fifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for<br><br>something less than a third of its length, was the mighty circular<br><br>basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.<br><br><br><br>To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,<br><br>extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled<br><br>the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some<br><br>twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,<br><br>for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.<br><br><br><br>The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was<br><br>nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each<br><br>successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one<br><br>of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From<br><br>that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last<br><br>only spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they<br><br>all bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs<br><br>were the most arched.  In some of the Arsacides they are used for<br><br>beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.<br><br><br><br>In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the<br><br>circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton<br><br>of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form.  The<br><br>largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that<br><br>part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth.  Now, the<br><br>greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must<br><br>have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib<br><br>measured but little more than eight feet.  So that this rib only<br><br>conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that<br><br>part.  Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all<br><br>that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,<br><br>muscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here<br><br>saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and<br><br>majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!<br><br><br><br>How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to<br><br>try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over<br><br>his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.<br><br>Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings<br><br>of his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the<br><br>fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.<br><br><br><br>But the spine.  For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a<br><br>crane, to pile its bones high up on end.  No speedy enterprise.  But<br><br>now it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.<br><br><br><br>There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are<br><br>not locked together.  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks<br><br>on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry.  The<br><br>largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,<br><br>and in depth more than four.  The smallest, where the spine tapers<br><br>away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something<br><br>like a white billiard-ball.  I was told that there were still smaller<br><br>ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the<br><br>priest's children, who had stolen them to play marbles with.  Thus we<br><br>see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off<br><br>at last into simple child's play.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 104<br><br><br><br>The Fossil Whale.<br><br><br><br><br><br>From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon<br><br>to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate.  Would you, you could<br><br>not compress him.  By good rights he should only be treated of in<br><br>imperial folio.  Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to<br><br>tail, and the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the<br><br>gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like<br><br>great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck<br><br>of a line-of-battle-ship.<br><br><br><br>Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me<br><br>to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not<br><br>overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him<br><br>out to the uttermost coil of his bowels.  Having already described<br><br>him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities,<br><br>it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous,<br><br>and antediluvian point of view.  Applied to any other creature than<br><br>the Leviathan--to an ant or a flea--such portly terms might justly be<br><br>deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent.  But when Leviathan is the text,<br><br>the case is altered.  Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under<br><br>the weightiest words of the dictionary.  And here be it said, that<br><br>whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these<br><br>dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of<br><br>Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous<br><br>lexicographer's uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a<br><br>lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.<br><br><br><br>One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,<br><br>though it may seem but an ordinary one.  How, then, with me, writing<br><br>of this Leviathan?  Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard<br><br>capitals.  Give me a condor's quill!  Give me Vesuvius' crater for an<br><br>inkstand!  Friends, hold my arms!  For in the mere act of penning my<br><br>thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with<br><br>their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the<br><br>whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and<br><br>men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the<br><br>revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole<br><br>universe, not excluding its suburbs.  Such, and so magnifying, is the<br><br>virtue of a large and liberal theme!  We expand to its bulk.  To<br><br>produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.  No great and<br><br>enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be<br><br>who have tried it.<br><br><br><br>Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my<br><br>credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time<br><br>I have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches,<br><br>canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts.<br><br>Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that<br><br>while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of<br><br>monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics<br><br>discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the<br><br>connecting, or at any rate intercepted links, between the<br><br>antichronical creatures, and those whose remote posterity are said to<br><br>have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered<br><br>belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the<br><br>superficial formations.  And though none of them precisely answer to<br><br>any known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin<br><br>to them in general respects, to justify their taking rank as<br><br>Cetacean fossils.<br><br><br><br>Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their<br><br>bones and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various<br><br>intervals, been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in<br><br>France, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana,<br><br>Mississippi, and Alabama.  Among the more curious of such remains is<br><br>part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue<br><br>Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the<br><br>palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the<br><br>great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon's time.  Cuvier pronounced these<br><br>fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic<br><br>species.<br><br><br><br>But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost<br><br>complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,<br><br>on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama.  The awe-stricken<br><br>credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the<br><br>fallen angels.  The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and<br><br>bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus.  But some specimen bones<br><br>of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it<br><br>turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a<br><br>departed species.  A significant illustration of the fact, again and<br><br>again repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes<br><br>but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body.  So Owen<br><br>rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the<br><br>London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the<br><br>most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have<br><br>blotted out of existence.<br><br><br><br>When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,<br><br>jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances<br><br>to the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing<br><br>on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical<br><br>Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back<br><br>to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun;<br><br>for time began with man.  Here Saturn's grey chaos rolls over me, and<br><br>I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when<br><br>wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics;<br><br>and in all the 25,000 miles of this world's circumference, not an<br><br>inhabitable hand's breadth of land was visible.  Then the whole world<br><br>was the whale's; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the<br><br>present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs.  Who can show a<br><br>pedigree like Leviathan?  Ahab's harpoon had shed older blood than<br><br>the Pharaoh's.  Methuselah seems a school-boy.  I look round to shake<br><br>hands with Shem.  I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced<br><br>existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been<br><br>before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.<br><br><br><br>But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the<br><br>stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his<br><br>ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to<br><br>claim for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the<br><br>unmistakable print of his fin.  In an apartment of the great temple<br><br>of Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the<br><br>granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in<br><br>centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures<br><br>on the celestial globe of the moderns.  Gliding among them, old<br><br>Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere,<br><br>centuries before Solomon was cradled.<br><br><br><br>Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the<br><br>antiquity of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as<br><br>set down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.<br><br><br><br>"Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams<br><br>of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are<br><br>oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore.  The Common People imagine,<br><br>that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple, no Whale can<br><br>pass it without immediate death.  But the truth of the Matter is,<br><br>that on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two<br><br>Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon 'em.<br><br>They keep a Whale's Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which<br><br>lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch,<br><br>the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel's Back.<br><br>This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years<br><br>before I saw it.  Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet who<br><br>prophesy'd of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do not stand<br><br>to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the<br><br>Base of the Temple."<br><br><br><br>In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be<br><br>a Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 105<br><br><br><br>Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish?--Will He Perish?<br><br><br><br><br><br>Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from<br><br>the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,<br><br>in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from<br><br>the original bulk of his sires.<br><br><br><br>But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the<br><br>present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are<br><br>found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period<br><br>prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those<br><br>belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its<br><br>earlier ones.<br><br><br><br>Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the<br><br>Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than<br><br>seventy feet in length in the skeleton.  Whereas, we have already<br><br>seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton<br><br>of a large sized modern whale.  And I have heard, on whalemen's<br><br>authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet<br><br>long at the time of capture.<br><br><br><br>But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an<br><br>advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods;<br><br>may it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?<br><br><br><br>Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of<br><br>such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally.  For<br><br>Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and<br><br>Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in<br><br>length--Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales!  And even in the<br><br>days of Banks and Solander, Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish<br><br>member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales<br><br>(reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards;<br><br>that is, three hundred and sixty feet.  And Lacepede, the French<br><br>naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning<br><br>of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred<br><br>metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.  And this work was<br><br>published so late as A.D. 1825.<br><br><br><br>But will any whaleman believe these stories?  No.  The whale of<br><br>to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny's time.  And if ever I go<br><br>where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to<br><br>tell him so.  Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the<br><br>Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even<br><br>Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern<br><br>Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals<br><br>sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the<br><br>relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove<br><br>that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only<br><br>equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kine;<br><br>in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the<br><br>whale alone should have degenerated.<br><br><br><br>But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more<br><br>recondite Nantucketers.  Whether owing to the almost omniscient<br><br>look-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even<br><br>through Behring's straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and<br><br>lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted<br><br>along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan<br><br>can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether<br><br>he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last<br><br>whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself<br><br>evaporate in the final puff.<br><br><br><br>Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of<br><br>buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands<br><br>the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and<br><br>scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous<br><br>river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a<br><br>dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would<br><br>seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape<br><br>speedy extinction.<br><br><br><br>But you must look at this matter in every light.  Though so short a<br><br>period ago--not a good lifetime--the census of the buffalo in<br><br>Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the<br><br>present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region;<br><br>and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of<br><br>man; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily<br><br>forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.  Forty men in one ship<br><br>hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done<br><br>extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of<br><br>forty fish.  Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian<br><br>hunters and trappers of the West, when the far west (in whose sunset<br><br>suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the same number of<br><br>moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on horse<br><br>instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty<br><br>thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be<br><br>statistically stated.<br><br><br><br>Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the<br><br>gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former<br><br>years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in<br><br>small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in<br><br>consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much<br><br>more remunerative.  Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those<br><br>whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in<br><br>immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries,<br><br>yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into<br><br>vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.  That is all.  And<br><br>equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called<br><br>whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years<br><br>abounding with them, hence that species also is declining.  For they<br><br>are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no<br><br>longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and<br><br>remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar<br><br>spectacle.<br><br><br><br>Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have<br><br>two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever<br><br>remain impregnable.  And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the<br><br>frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the<br><br>savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at<br><br>last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate<br><br>glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes;<br><br>and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all<br><br>pursuit from man.<br><br><br><br>But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one<br><br>cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that<br><br>this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their<br><br>battalions.  But though for some time past a number of these whales,<br><br>not less than 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor'-west<br><br>coast by the Americans alone; yet there are considerations which<br><br>render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing<br><br>argument in this matter.<br><br><br><br>Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the<br><br>populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what<br><br>shall we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at<br><br>one hunting the King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those<br><br>regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate<br><br>climes.  And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants,<br><br>which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by<br><br>Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the<br><br>East--if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may the<br><br>great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate<br><br>in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas,<br><br>Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea<br><br>combined.<br><br><br><br>Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity<br><br>of whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,<br><br>therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult<br><br>generations must be contemporary.  And what that is, we may soon<br><br>gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and<br><br>family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men,<br><br>women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding<br><br>this countless host to the present human population of the globe.<br><br><br><br>Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his<br><br>species, however perishable in his individuality.  He swam the seas<br><br>before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the<br><br>Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin.  In Noah's flood he<br><br>despised Noah's Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded,<br><br>like the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale<br><br>will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the<br><br>equatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 106<br><br><br><br>Ahab's Leg.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel<br><br>Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence<br><br>to his own person.  He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of<br><br>his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock.<br><br>And when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he<br><br>so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman<br><br>(it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly<br><br>enough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional<br><br>twist and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all<br><br>appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.<br><br><br><br>And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his<br><br>pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to<br><br>the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood.  For it<br><br>had not been very long prior to the Pequod's sailing from Nantucket,<br><br>that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and<br><br>insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable<br><br>casualty, his ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it<br><br>had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it<br><br>without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely<br><br>cured.<br><br><br><br>Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that<br><br>all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct<br><br>issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the<br><br>most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as<br><br>inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with<br><br>every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their like.<br><br>Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and<br><br>posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy.<br><br>For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain<br><br>canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have<br><br>no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary,<br><br>shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair;<br><br>whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to<br><br>themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the<br><br>grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in<br><br>the deeper analysis of the thing.  For, thought Ahab, while even the<br><br>highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness<br><br>lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic<br><br>significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their<br><br>diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction.  To trail the<br><br>genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among<br><br>the sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of<br><br>all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round<br><br>harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the gods<br><br>themselves are not for ever glad.  The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark<br><br>in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.<br><br><br><br>Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more<br><br>properly, in set way, have been disclosed before.  With many other<br><br>particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to<br><br>some, why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after<br><br>the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such<br><br>Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought<br><br>speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.<br><br>Captain Peleg's bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means<br><br>adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab's deeper part, every<br><br>revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory<br><br>light.  But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at<br><br>least.  That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary<br><br>recluseness.  And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,<br><br>dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege<br><br>of a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above<br><br>hinted casualty--remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by<br><br>Ahab--invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the<br><br>land of spirits and of wails.  So that, through their zeal for him,<br><br>they had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the<br><br>knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till<br><br>a considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the<br><br>Pequod's decks.<br><br><br><br>But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the<br><br>air, or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or<br><br>not with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he<br><br>took plain practical procedures;--he called the carpenter.<br><br><br><br>And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without<br><br>delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him<br><br>supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale)<br><br>which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a<br><br>careful selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be<br><br>secured.  This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg<br><br>completed that night; and to provide all the fittings for it,<br><br>independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use.<br><br>Moreover, the ship's forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its<br><br>temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the affair, the<br><br>blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of<br><br>whatever iron contrivances might be needed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 107<br><br><br><br>The Carpenter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high<br><br>abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe.<br><br>But from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part,<br><br>they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and<br><br>hereditary.  But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing<br><br>an example of the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod's carpenter<br><br>was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.<br><br><br><br>Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those<br><br>belonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed,<br><br>practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings<br><br>collateral to his own; the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and<br><br>outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or<br><br>less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material.  But, besides the<br><br>application to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the<br><br>Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical<br><br>emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or<br><br>four years' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas.  For not to<br><br>speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:--repairing stove boats,<br><br>sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting<br><br>bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and<br><br>other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special<br><br>business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of<br><br>conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.<br><br><br><br>The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so<br><br>manifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished<br><br>with several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood.<br><br>At all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was<br><br>securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.<br><br><br><br>A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its<br><br>hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and<br><br>straightway files it smaller.  A lost land-bird of strange plumage<br><br>strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of<br><br>right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter<br><br>makes a pagoda-looking cage for it.  An oarsman sprains his wrist:<br><br>the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion.  Stubb longed for<br><br>vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar;<br><br>screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter<br><br>symmetrically supplies the constellation.  A sailor takes a fancy to<br><br>wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears.  Another<br><br>has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand<br><br>upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow<br><br>unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round<br><br>the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his<br><br>jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.<br><br><br><br>Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike<br><br>indifferent and without respect in all.  Teeth he accounted bits of<br><br>ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held<br><br>for capstans.  But while now upon so wide a field thus variously<br><br>accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all<br><br>this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence.  But<br><br>not precisely so.  For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for<br><br>a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it<br><br>so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed<br><br>one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible<br><br>world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still<br><br>eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig<br><br>foundations for cathedrals.  Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in<br><br>him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying<br><br>heartlessness;--yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,<br><br>crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now<br><br>and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served<br><br>to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle<br><br>of Noah's ark.  Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long<br><br>wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no<br><br>moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward<br><br>clingings might have originally pertained to him?  He was a stript<br><br>abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe;<br><br>living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.  You<br><br>might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved<br><br>a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem<br><br>to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had<br><br>been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or<br><br>uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal<br><br>process.  He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had<br><br>one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers.  He<br><br>was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, MULTUM IN<br><br>PARVO, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior--though a little<br><br>swelled--of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of<br><br>various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,<br><br>pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers.  So, if his superiors<br><br>wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do<br><br>was to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for<br><br>tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.<br><br><br><br>Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,<br><br>was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton.  If he did not have<br><br>a common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow<br><br>anomalously did its duty.  What that was, whether essence of<br><br>quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no telling.  But<br><br>there it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or<br><br>more.  And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning<br><br>life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a great part of the<br><br>time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also<br><br>hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box and this<br><br>soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep himself<br><br>awake.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 108<br><br><br><br>Ahab and the Carpenter.<br><br><br><br>The Deck--First Night Watch.<br><br><br><br><br><br>(CARPENTER STANDING BEFORE HIS VICE-BENCH, AND BY THE LIGHT OF TWO<br><br>LANTERNS BUSILY FILING THE IVORY JOIST FOR THE LEG, WHICH JOIST IS<br><br>FIRMLY FIXED IN THE VICE.

Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says<br><br>he's queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;<br><br>he's queer, says Stubb; he's queer--queer, queer; and keeps dinning<br><br>it into Mr. Starbuck all the time--queer--sir--queer, queer, very<br><br>queer.  And here's his leg!  Yes, now that I think of it, here's his<br><br>bedfellow! has a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife!  And this is<br><br>his leg; he'll stand on this.  What was that now about one leg<br><br>standing in three places, and all three places standing in one<br><br>hell--how was that?  Oh!  I don't wonder he looked so scornful at me!<br><br>I'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that's only<br><br>haphazard-like.  Then, a short, little old body like me, should never<br><br>undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built<br><br>captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and<br><br>there's a great cry for life-boats.  And here's the heron's leg! long<br><br>and slim, sure enough!  Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a<br><br>lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a<br><br>tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses.  But<br><br>Ahab; oh he's a hard driver.  Look, driven one leg to death, and<br><br>spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.<br><br>Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and<br><br>let's finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with<br><br>his horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round<br><br>collecting old beer barrels, to fill 'em up again.  What a leg this<br><br>is!  It looks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the<br><br>core; he'll be standing on this to-morrow; he'll be taking altitudes<br><br>on it.  Halloa!  I almost forgot the little oval slate, smoothed<br><br>ivory, where he figures up the latitude.  So, so; chisel, file, and<br><br>sand-paper, now!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 109<br><br><br><br>Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.<br><br><br><br><br><br>According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo!<br><br>no inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must<br><br>have sprung a bad leak.  Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went<br><br>down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*<br><br><br><br><br><br>*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it<br><br>is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and<br><br>drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying<br><br>intervals, is removed by the ship's pumps.  Hereby the casks are<br><br>sought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the<br><br>withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in<br><br>the precious cargo.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa<br><br>and the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets<br><br>from the China waters into the Pacific.  And so Starbuck found Ahab<br><br>with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him;<br><br>and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the<br><br>Japanese islands--Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke.  With his snow-white<br><br>new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a<br><br>long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man,<br><br>with his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and<br><br>tracing his old courses again.<br><br><br><br>"Who's there?" hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning<br><br>round to it.  "On deck!  Begone!"<br><br><br><br>"Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I.  The oil in the hold is leaking,<br><br>sir.  We must up Burtons and break out."<br><br><br><br>"Up Burtons and break out?  Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to<br><br>here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?"<br><br><br><br>"Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make<br><br>good in a year.  What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth<br><br>saving, sir."<br><br><br><br>"So it is, so it is; if we get it."<br><br><br><br>"I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir."<br><br><br><br>"And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all.  Begone!  Let it<br><br>leak!  I'm all aleak myself.  Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of<br><br>leaky casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that's a<br><br>far worse plight than the Pequod's, man.  Yet I don't stop to plug my<br><br>leak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to<br><br>plug it, even if found, in this life's howling gale?  Starbuck!<br><br>I'll not have the Burtons hoisted."<br><br><br><br>"What will the owners say, sir?"<br><br><br><br>"Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons.<br><br>What cares Ahab?  Owners, owners?  Thou art always prating to me,<br><br>Starbuck, about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my<br><br>conscience.  But look ye, the only real owner of anything is its<br><br>commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this ship's keel.--On<br><br>deck!"<br><br><br><br>"Captain Ahab," said the reddening mate, moving further into the<br><br>cabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it<br><br>almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest<br><br>outward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than<br><br>half distrustful of itself; "A better man than I might well pass over<br><br>in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye,<br><br>and in a happier, Captain Ahab."<br><br><br><br>"Devils!  Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of<br><br>me?--On deck!"<br><br><br><br>"Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat.  And I do dare, sir--to be<br><br>forbearing!  Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,<br><br>Captain Ahab?"<br><br><br><br>Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most<br><br>South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,<br><br>exclaimed: "There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one<br><br>Captain that is lord over the Pequod.--On deck!"<br><br><br><br>For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery<br><br>cheeks, you would have almost thought that he had really received the<br><br>blaze of the levelled tube.  But, mastering his emotion, he half<br><br>calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and<br><br>said: "Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask<br><br>thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab<br><br>beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man."<br><br><br><br>"He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!"<br><br>murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared.  "What's that he said--Ahab<br><br>beware of Ahab--there's something there!"  Then unconsciously using<br><br>the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the<br><br>little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed,<br><br>and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.<br><br><br><br>"Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck," he said lowly to the<br><br>mate; then raising his voice to the crew: "Furl the t'gallant-sails,<br><br>and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up<br><br>Burton, and break out in the main-hold."<br><br><br><br>It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as<br><br>respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.  It may have been a flash of<br><br>honesty in him; or mere prudential policy which, under the<br><br>circumstance, imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open<br><br>disaffection, however transient, in the important chief officer of<br><br>his ship.  However it was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons<br><br>were hoisted.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 110<br><br><br><br>Queequeg in His Coffin.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold<br><br>were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off.  So, it<br><br>being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the<br><br>slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight<br><br>sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above.  So deep did<br><br>they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the<br><br>lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy<br><br>corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of<br><br>the posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the<br><br>flood.  Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and<br><br>shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till<br><br>at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull<br><br>echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and<br><br>reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn.<br><br>Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in<br><br>his head.  Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.<br><br><br><br>Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast<br><br>bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him<br><br>nigh to his endless end.<br><br><br><br>Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;<br><br>dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the<br><br>higher you rise the harder you toil.  So with poor Queequeg, who, as<br><br>harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale,<br><br>but--as we have elsewhere seen--mount his dead back in a rolling sea;<br><br>and finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating<br><br>all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the<br><br>clumsiest casks and see to their stowage.  To be short, among<br><br>whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.<br><br><br><br>Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should<br><br>have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there;<br><br>where, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was<br><br>crawling about amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted<br><br>lizard at the bottom of a well.  And a well, or an ice-house, it<br><br>somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the<br><br>heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a<br><br>fever; and at last, after some days' suffering, laid him in his<br><br>hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death.  How he wasted<br><br>and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there seemed<br><br>but little left of him but his frame and tattooing.  But as all else<br><br>in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes,<br><br>nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a<br><br>strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you<br><br>there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health<br><br>in him which could not die, or be weakened.  And like circles on the<br><br>water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed<br><br>rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity.  An awe that<br><br>cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this<br><br>waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld<br><br>who were bystanders when Zoroaster died.  For whatever is truly<br><br>wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books.<br><br>And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike<br><br>impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the<br><br>dead could adequately tell.  So that--let us say it again--no dying<br><br>Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose<br><br>mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as<br><br>he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed<br><br>gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean's invisible<br><br>flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.<br><br><br><br>Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,<br><br>what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he<br><br>asked.  He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day<br><br>was just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket<br><br>he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the<br><br>rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned<br><br>that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark<br><br>canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for<br><br>it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a<br><br>dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be<br><br>floated away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they<br><br>believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible<br><br>horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue<br><br>heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way.  He added,<br><br>that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,<br><br>according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the<br><br>death-devouring sharks.  No: he desired a canoe like those of<br><br>Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like<br><br>a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that<br><br>involved but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.<br><br><br><br>Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter<br><br>was at once commanded to do Queequeg's bidding, whatever it might<br><br>include.  There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber<br><br>aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the<br><br>aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks<br><br>the coffin was recommended to be made.  No sooner was the carpenter<br><br>apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all<br><br>the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the<br><br>forecastle and took Queequeg's measure with great accuracy, regularly<br><br>chalking Queequeg's person as he shifted the rule.<br><br><br><br>"Ah! poor fellow! he'll have to die now," ejaculated the Long Island<br><br>sailor.<br><br><br><br>Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and<br><br>general reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length<br><br>the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting<br><br>two notches at its extremities.  This done, he marshalled the planks<br><br>and his tools, and to work.<br><br><br><br>When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he<br><br>lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring<br><br>whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.<br><br><br><br>Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the<br><br>people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every<br><br>one's consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly<br><br>brought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all<br><br>mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since<br><br>they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows<br><br>ought to be indulged.<br><br><br><br>Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with<br><br>an attentive eye.  He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden<br><br>stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin<br><br>along with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,<br><br>also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of<br><br>fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth<br><br>scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being<br><br>rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his<br><br>final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had.<br><br>He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag<br><br>and bring out his little god, Yojo.  Then crossing his arms on his<br><br>breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he<br><br>called it) to be placed over him.  The head part turned over with a<br><br>leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but<br><br>his composed countenance in view.  "Rarmai" (it will do; it is easy),<br><br>he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.<br><br><br><br>But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all<br><br>this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings,<br><br>took him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.<br><br><br><br>"Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving?<br><br>where go ye now?  But if the currents carry ye to those sweet<br><br>Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye<br><br>do one little errand for me?  Seek out one Pip, who's now been<br><br>missing long: I think he's in those far Antilles.  If ye find him,<br><br>then comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he's left his<br><br>tambourine behind;--I found it.  Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!  Now, Queequeg,<br><br>die; and I'll beat ye your dying march."<br><br><br><br>"I have heard," murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, "that in<br><br>violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;<br><br>and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in<br><br>their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been<br><br>really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars.  So, to my<br><br>fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings<br><br>heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes.  Where learned he that,<br><br>but there?--Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now."<br><br><br><br>"Form two and two!  Let's make a General of him!  Ho, where's his<br><br>harpoon?  Lay it across here.--Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza!  Oh for a<br><br>game cock now to sit upon his head and crow!  Queequeg dies<br><br>game!--mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!--take ye good heed of that;<br><br>Queequeg dies game!  I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he<br><br>died a coward; died all a'shiver;--out upon Pip!  Hark ye; if ye find<br><br>Pip, tell all the Antilles he's a runaway; a coward, a coward, a<br><br>coward!  Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat!  I'd never beat my<br><br>tambourine over base Pip, and hail him General, if he were once more<br><br>dying here.  No, no! shame upon all cowards--shame upon them!  Let 'em<br><br>go drown like Pip, that jumped from a whale-boat.  Shame! shame!"<br><br><br><br>During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.<br><br>Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.<br><br><br><br>But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now<br><br>that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;<br><br>soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon,<br><br>when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,<br><br>that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical<br><br>moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was<br><br>leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he<br><br>could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live<br><br>or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He<br><br>answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a<br><br>man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:<br><br>nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,<br><br>unintelligent destroyer of that sort.<br><br><br><br>Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and<br><br>civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months<br><br>convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well<br><br>again in a day.  So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at<br><br>length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but<br><br>eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,<br><br>threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned<br><br>a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat,<br><br>and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.<br><br><br><br>With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and<br><br>emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.<br><br>Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of<br><br>grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was<br><br>striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on<br><br>his body.  And this tattooing had been the work of a departed<br><br>prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had<br><br>written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the<br><br>earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that<br><br>Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous<br><br>work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read,<br><br>though his own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were<br><br>therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living<br><br>parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the<br><br>last.  And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab<br><br>that wild exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from<br><br>surveying poor Queequeg--"Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 111<br><br><br><br>The Pacific.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great<br><br>South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear<br><br>Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my<br><br>youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a<br><br>thousand leagues of blue.<br><br><br><br>There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose<br><br>gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath;<br><br>like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried<br><br>Evangelist St. John.  And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures,<br><br>wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters' Fields of all four<br><br>continents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow<br><br>unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned<br><br>dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls,<br><br>lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds;<br><br>the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.<br><br><br><br>To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld,<br><br>must ever after be the sea of his adoption.  It rolls the midmost<br><br>waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its<br><br>arms.  The same waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian<br><br>towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men, and lave<br><br>the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than<br><br>Abraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and<br><br>low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans.<br><br>Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the world's whole bulk<br><br>about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart<br><br>of earth.  Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs must own the<br><br>seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.<br><br><br><br>But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain, as standing like an<br><br>iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with<br><br>one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee<br><br>isles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with<br><br>the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea;<br><br>that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming.<br><br>Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and gliding<br><br>towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man's purpose<br><br>intensified itself.  His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the<br><br>Delta of his forehead's veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his<br><br>very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, "Stern all!<br><br>the White Whale spouts thick blood!"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 112<br><br><br><br>The Blacksmith.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned<br><br>in these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active<br><br>pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered<br><br>old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again,<br><br>after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still<br><br>retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being<br><br>now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and<br><br>bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or<br><br>new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture.  Often he would<br><br>be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding<br><br>boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching<br><br>his every sooty movement, as he toiled.  Nevertheless, this old man's<br><br>was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm.  No murmur, no<br><br>impatience, no petulance did come from him.  Silent, slow, and<br><br>solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he<br><br>toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of<br><br>his hammer the heavy beating of his heart.  And so it was.--Most<br><br>miserable!<br><br><br><br>A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful<br><br>appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage<br><br>excited the curiosity of the mariners.  And to the importunity of<br><br>their persisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came<br><br>to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched<br><br>fate.<br><br><br><br>Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight, on the<br><br>road running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly<br><br>felt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a<br><br>leaning, dilapidated barn.  The issue was, the loss of the<br><br>extremities of both feet.  Out of this revelation, part by part, at<br><br>last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as<br><br>yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's drama.<br><br><br><br>He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly<br><br>encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin.  He had<br><br>been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a<br><br>house and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife,<br><br>and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a<br><br>cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove.  But one night, under<br><br>cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning<br><br>disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and<br><br>robbed them all of everything.  And darker yet to tell, the<br><br>blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his<br><br>family's heart.  It was the Bottle Conjuror!  Upon the opening of<br><br>that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home.<br><br>Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's<br><br>shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate<br><br>entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife<br><br>listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to<br><br>the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose<br><br>reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, came<br><br>up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's<br><br>iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber.<br><br><br><br>Oh, woe on woe!  Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?<br><br>Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin<br><br>came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and<br><br>her orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their<br><br>after years; and all of them a care-killing competency.  But Death<br><br>plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily<br><br>toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left<br><br>the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life<br><br>should make him easier to harvest.<br><br><br><br>Why tell the whole?  The blows of the basement hammer every day grew<br><br>more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the<br><br>last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,<br><br>glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the<br><br>bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold;<br><br>the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children<br><br>twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man<br><br>staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his<br><br>grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!<br><br><br><br>Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but<br><br>Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it<br><br>is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense<br><br>Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the<br><br>death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them some<br><br>interior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and<br><br>all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of<br><br>unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and<br><br>from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to<br><br>them--"Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the<br><br>guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without<br><br>dying for them.  Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your<br><br>now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious<br><br>than death.  Come hither! put up THY gravestone, too, within the<br><br>churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!"<br><br><br><br>Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by<br><br>fall of eve, the blacksmith's soul responded, Aye, I come!  And so<br><br>Perth went a-whaling.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 113<br><br><br><br>The Forge.<br><br><br><br><br><br>With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about<br><br>mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter<br><br>placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in<br><br>the coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab<br><br>came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag.<br><br>While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till<br><br>at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering<br><br>it upon the anvil--the red mass sending off the sparks in thick<br><br>hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.<br><br><br><br>"Are these thy Mother Carey's chickens, Perth? they are always flying<br><br>in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;--look here,<br><br>they burn; but thou--thou liv'st among them without a scorch."<br><br><br><br>"Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab," answered Perth,<br><br>resting for a moment on his hammer; "I am past scorching; not easily<br><br>can'st thou scorch a scar."<br><br><br><br>"Well, well; no more.  Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely<br><br>woeful to me.  In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in<br><br>others that is not mad.  Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why<br><br>dost thou not go mad?  How can'st thou endure without being mad?  Do<br><br>the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad?--What wert<br><br>thou making there?"<br><br><br><br>"Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it."<br><br><br><br>"And can'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such<br><br>hard usage as it had?"<br><br><br><br>"I think so, sir."<br><br><br><br>"And I suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never<br><br>mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?"<br><br><br><br>"Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one."<br><br><br><br>"Look ye here, then," cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning<br><br>with both hands on Perth's shoulders; "look ye here--HERE--can ye<br><br>smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith," sweeping one hand across<br><br>his ribbed brow; "if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I<br><br>lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my<br><br>eyes.  Answer!  Can'st thou smoothe this seam?"<br><br><br><br>"Oh! that is the one, sir!  Said I not all seams and dents but one?"<br><br><br><br>"Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for<br><br>though thou only see'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into<br><br>the bone of my skull--THAT is all wrinkles!  But, away with child's<br><br>play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day.  Look ye here!" jingling the<br><br>leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins.  "I, too, want a<br><br>harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part,<br><br>Perth; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone.<br><br>There's the stuff," flinging the pouch upon the anvil.  "Look ye,<br><br>blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of<br><br>racing horses."<br><br><br><br>"Horse-shoe stubbs, sir?  Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then,<br><br>the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work."<br><br><br><br>"I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from<br><br>the melted bones of murderers.  Quick! forge me the harpoon.  And<br><br>forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and<br><br>hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a<br><br>tow-line.  Quick!  I'll blow the fire."<br><br><br><br>When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one,<br><br>by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt.<br><br>"A flaw!" rejecting the last one.  "Work that over again, Perth."<br><br><br><br>This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when<br><br>Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron.  As, then,<br><br>with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing<br><br>to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed<br><br>forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed<br><br>silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking<br><br>some curse or some blessing on the toil.  But, as Ahab looked up, he<br><br>slid aside.<br><br><br><br>"What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?" muttered<br><br>Stubb, looking on from the forecastle.  "That Parsee smells fire like<br><br>a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan."<br><br><br><br>At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and<br><br>as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water<br><br>near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.<br><br><br><br>"Would'st thou brand me, Perth?" wincing for a moment with the pain;<br><br>"have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?"<br><br><br><br>"Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab.  Is not this<br><br>harpoon for the White Whale?"<br><br><br><br>"For the white fiend!  But now for the barbs; thou must make them<br><br>thyself, man.  Here are my razors--the best of steel; here, and make<br><br>the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea."<br><br><br><br>For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would<br><br>fain not use them.<br><br><br><br>"Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave,<br><br>sup, nor pray till--but here--to work!"<br><br><br><br>Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the<br><br>shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the<br><br>blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to<br><br>tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.<br><br><br><br>"No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.<br><br>Ahoy, there!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, pagans!  Will<br><br>ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?" holding it high<br><br>up.  A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes.  Three punctures were made<br><br>in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered.<br><br><br><br>"Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!"<br><br>deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured<br><br>the baptismal blood.<br><br><br><br>Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of<br><br>hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the<br><br>socket of the iron.  A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and<br><br>some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great<br><br>tension.  Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a<br><br>harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings,<br><br>Ahab exclaimed, "Good! and now for the seizings."<br><br><br><br>At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread<br><br>yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the<br><br>pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the<br><br>rope was traced half-way along the pole's length, and firmly secured<br><br>so, with intertwistings of twine.  This done, pole, iron, and<br><br>rope--like the Three Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily<br><br>stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the<br><br>sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank.<br><br>But ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet<br><br>most piteous sound was heard.  Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy<br><br>idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly<br><br>blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 114<br><br><br><br>The Gilder.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese<br><br>cruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery.<br><br>Often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and<br><br>twenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily<br><br>pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an<br><br>interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising;<br><br>though with but small success for their pains.<br><br><br><br>At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow<br><br>heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so<br><br>sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like<br><br>hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times<br><br>of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy<br><br>of the ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath<br><br>it; and would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but<br><br>conceals a remorseless fang.<br><br><br><br>These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a<br><br>certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he<br><br>regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing<br><br>only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through<br><br>high rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie:<br><br>as when the western emigrants' horses only show their erected ears,<br><br>while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.<br><br><br><br>The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these<br><br>there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied<br><br>children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when<br><br>the flowers of the woods are plucked.  And all this mixes with your<br><br>most mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting,<br><br>interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.<br><br><br><br>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as<br><br>temporary an effect on Ahab.  But if these secret golden keys did<br><br>seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his<br><br>breath upon them prove but tarnishing.<br><br><br><br>Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in<br><br>ye,--though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy<br><br>life,--in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning<br><br>clover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the<br><br>life immortal on them.  Would to God these blessed calms would last.<br><br>But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof:<br><br>calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm.  There is no steady<br><br>unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed<br><br>gradations, and at the last one pause:--through infancy's unconscious<br><br>spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common<br><br>doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's<br><br>pondering repose of If.  But once gone through, we trace the round<br><br>again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally.  Where lies<br><br>the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more?  In what rapt ether sails<br><br>the world, of which the weariest will never weary?  Where is the<br><br>foundling's father hidden?  Our souls are like those orphans whose<br><br>unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity<br><br>lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.<br><br><br><br>And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into<br><br>that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:--<br><br><br><br>"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's<br><br>eye!--Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping<br><br>cannibal ways.  Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look<br><br>deep down and do believe."<br><br><br><br>And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same<br><br>golden light:--<br><br><br><br>"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths<br><br>that he has always been jolly!"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 115<br><br><br><br>The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.<br><br><br><br><br><br>And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing<br><br>down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been<br><br>welded.<br><br><br><br>It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her<br><br>last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in<br><br>glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,<br><br>sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground,<br><br>previous to pointing her prow for home.<br><br><br><br>The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red<br><br>bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,<br><br>bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long<br><br>lower jaw of the last whale they had slain.  Signals, ensigns, and<br><br>jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side.<br><br>Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels<br><br>of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender<br><br>breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was<br><br>a brazen lamp.<br><br><br><br>As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most<br><br>surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising<br><br>in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months<br><br>without securing a single fish.  Not only had barrels of beef and<br><br>bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm,<br><br>but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the<br><br>ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the<br><br>captain's and officers' state-rooms.  Even the cabin table itself<br><br>had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the<br><br>broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a<br><br>centrepiece.  In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked<br><br>and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added,<br><br>that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled<br><br>it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it;<br><br>that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled<br><br>them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the<br><br>captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his<br><br>hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.<br><br><br><br>As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the<br><br>barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and<br><br>drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her<br><br>huge try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like POKE or stomach<br><br>skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the<br><br>clenched hands of the crew.  On the quarter-deck, the mates and<br><br>harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped<br><br>with them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an<br><br>ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between the foremast and<br><br>mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of<br><br>whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious jig.  Meanwhile,<br><br>others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of<br><br>the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed.  You would<br><br>have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such<br><br>wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were<br><br>being hurled into the sea.<br><br><br><br>Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the<br><br>ship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was<br><br>full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual<br><br>diversion.<br><br><br><br>And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,<br><br>with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other's<br><br>wakes--one all jubilations for things passed, the other all<br><br>forebodings as to things to come--their two captains in themselves<br><br>impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.<br><br><br><br>"Come aboard, come aboard!" cried the gay Bachelor's commander,<br><br>lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.<br><br><br><br>"Hast seen the White Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply.<br><br><br><br>"No; only heard of him; but don't believe in him at all," said the<br><br>other good-humoredly.  "Come aboard!"<br><br><br><br>"Thou art too damned jolly.  Sail on.  Hast lost any men?"<br><br><br><br>"Not enough to speak of--two islanders, that's all;--but come aboard,<br><br>old hearty, come along.  I'll soon take that black from your brow.<br><br>Come along, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and<br><br>homeward-bound."<br><br><br><br>"How wondrous familiar is a fool!" muttered Ahab; then aloud, "Thou<br><br>art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me<br><br>an empty ship, and outward-bound.  So go thy ways, and I will mine.<br><br>Forward there!  Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!"<br><br><br><br>And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the<br><br>other stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted;<br><br>the crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards<br><br>the receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor's men never heeding their<br><br>gaze for the lively revelry they were in.  And as Ahab, leaning over<br><br>the taffrail, eyed the homewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a<br><br>small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial,<br><br>seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that<br><br>vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 116<br><br><br><br>The Dying Whale.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's favourites<br><br>sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the<br><br>rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out.  So<br><br>seemed it with the Pequod.  For next day after encountering the gay<br><br>Bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by<br><br>Ahab.<br><br><br><br>It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the<br><br>crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and<br><br>sky, sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness<br><br>and such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that<br><br>rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green<br><br>convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze,<br><br>wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper<br><br>hymns.<br><br><br><br>Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had<br><br>sterned off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings<br><br>from the now tranquil boat.  For that strange spectacle observable in<br><br>all sperm whales dying--the turning sunwards of the head, and so<br><br>expiring--that strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening,<br><br>somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.<br><br><br><br>"He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly, his<br><br>homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions.  He<br><br>too worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the<br><br>sun!--Oh that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring<br><br>sights.  Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal<br><br>or woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions<br><br>no rocks furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows<br><br>have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine<br><br>upon the Niger's unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full<br><br>of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the<br><br>corpse, and it heads some other way.<br><br><br><br>"Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast<br><br>builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these<br><br>unverdured seas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly<br><br>speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed<br><br>burial of its after calm.

Ha!<br><br>Such a sight we shall not soon see."<br><br><br><br>"Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man."<br><br><br><br>"And what was that saying about thyself?"<br><br><br><br>"Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot."<br><br><br><br>"And when thou art so gone before--if that ever befall--then ere I<br><br>can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?--Was it<br><br>not so?  Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot!  I have<br><br>here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it."<br><br><br><br>"Take another pledge, old man," said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted<br><br>up like fire-flies in the gloom--"Hemp only can kill thee."<br><br><br><br>"The gallows, ye mean.--I am immortal then, on land and on sea,"<br><br>cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;--"Immortal on land and on sea!"<br><br><br><br>Both were silent again, as one man.  The grey dawn came on, and the<br><br>slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere noon the dead<br><br>whale was brought to the ship.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 118<br><br><br><br>The Quadrant.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,<br><br>coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman<br><br>would ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners<br><br>quickly run to the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes<br><br>centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to<br><br>point the ship's prow for the equator.  In good time the order came.<br><br>It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his<br><br>high-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of<br><br>the sun to determine his latitude.<br><br><br><br>Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of<br><br>effulgences.  That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing<br><br>focus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass.  The sky<br><br>looks lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this<br><br>nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of<br><br>God's throne.  Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured<br><br>glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire.  So,<br><br>swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his<br><br>astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in<br><br>that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the<br><br>sun should gain its precise meridian.  Meantime while his whole<br><br>attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the<br><br>ship's deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's, was eyeing the same<br><br>sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and<br><br>his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness.  At length<br><br>the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory<br><br>leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise<br><br>instant.  Then falling into a moment's revery, he again looked up<br><br>towards the sun and murmured to himself: "Thou sea-mark! thou high<br><br>and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I AM--but canst thou<br><br>cast the least hint where I SHALL be?  Or canst thou tell where some<br><br>other thing besides me is this moment living?  Where is Moby Dick?<br><br>This instant thou must be eyeing him.  These eyes of mine look into<br><br>the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye<br><br>that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,<br><br>thither side of thee, thou sun!"<br><br><br><br>Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its<br><br>numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:<br><br>"Foolish toy! babies' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,<br><br>and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but<br><br>what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where<br><br>thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that<br><br>holds thee: no! not one jot more!  Thou canst not tell where one drop<br><br>of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with<br><br>thy impotence thou insultest the sun!  Science!  Curse thee, thou<br><br>vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to<br><br>that heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes<br><br>are even now scorched with thy light, O sun!  Level by nature to this<br><br>earth's horizon are the glances of man's eyes; not shot from the<br><br>crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament.<br><br>Curse thee, thou quadrant!" dashing it to the deck, "no longer will I<br><br>guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship's compass, and the level<br><br>deadreckoning, by log and by line; THESE shall conduct me, and show<br><br>me my place on the sea.  Aye," lighting from the boat to the deck,<br><br>"thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on<br><br>high; thus I split and destroy thee!"<br><br><br><br>As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and<br><br>dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a<br><br>fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself--these passed over<br><br>the mute, motionless Parsee's face.  Unobserved he rose and glided<br><br>away; while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen<br><br>clustered together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing<br><br>the deck, shouted out--"To the braces!  Up helm!--square in!"<br><br><br><br>In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled<br><br>upon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised<br><br>upon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting<br><br>on one sufficient steed.<br><br><br><br>Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod's<br><br>tumultuous way, and Ahab's also, as he went lurching along the deck.<br><br><br><br>"I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full<br><br>of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,<br><br>down, to dumbest dust.  Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of<br><br>thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!"<br><br><br><br>"Aye," cried Stubb, "but sea-coal ashes--mind ye that, Mr.<br><br>Starbuck--sea-coal, not your common charcoal.  Well, well; I heard<br><br>Ahab mutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands<br><br>of mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.'  And damn me,<br><br>Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 119<br><br><br><br>The Candles.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal<br><br>crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure.  Skies the most<br><br>effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows<br><br>tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands.  So, too, it is, that<br><br>in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst<br><br>of all storms, the Typhoon.  It will sometimes burst from out that<br><br>cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.<br><br><br><br>Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and<br><br>bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly<br><br>ahead.  When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the<br><br>thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled<br><br>masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of<br><br>the tempest had left for its after sport.<br><br><br><br>Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at<br><br>every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional<br><br>disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb<br><br>and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer<br><br>lashing of the boats.  But all their pains seemed naught.  Though<br><br>lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat<br><br>(Ahab's) did not escape.  A great rolling sea, dashing high up<br><br>against the reeling ship's high teetering side, stove in the boat's<br><br>bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through like a<br><br>sieve.<br><br><br><br>"Bad work, bad work!  Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck,<br><br>"but the sea will have its way.  Stubb, for one, can't fight it.  You<br><br>see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it<br><br>leaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring!  But<br><br>as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck<br><br>here.  But never mind; it's all in fun: so the old song<br><br>says;"--(SINGS.)<br><br><br><br>Oh! jolly is the gale,<br><br>And a joker is the whale,<br><br>A' flourishin' his tail,--<br><br>Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!<br><br><br><br>The scud all a flyin',<br><br>That's his flip only foamin';<br><br>When he stirs in the spicin',--<br><br>Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!<br><br><br><br>Thunder splits the ships,<br><br>But he only smacks his lips,<br><br>A tastin' of this flip,--<br><br>Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Avast Stubb," cried Starbuck, "let the Typhoon sing, and strike his<br><br>harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold<br><br>thy peace."<br><br><br><br>"But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a<br><br>coward; and I sing to keep up my spirits.  And I tell you what it is,<br><br>Mr. Starbuck, there's no way to stop my singing in this world but to<br><br>cut my throat.  And when that's done, ten to one I sing ye the<br><br>doxology for a wind-up."<br><br><br><br>"Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own."<br><br><br><br>"What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else,<br><br>never mind how foolish?"<br><br><br><br>"Here!" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing<br><br>his hand towards the weather bow, "markest thou not that the gale<br><br>comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby<br><br>Dick? the very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat<br><br>there; where is that stove?  In the stern-sheets, man; where he is<br><br>wont to stand--his stand-point is stove, man!  Now jump overboard,<br><br>and sing away, if thou must!<br><br><br><br>"I don't half understand ye: what's in the wind?"<br><br><br><br>"Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to<br><br>Nantucket," soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb's<br><br>question.  "The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn<br><br>it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home.  Yonder, to<br><br>windward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward--I see<br><br>it lightens up there; but not with the lightning."<br><br><br><br>At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness,<br><br>following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at<br><br>the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.<br><br><br><br>"Who's there?"<br><br><br><br>"Old Thunder!" said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his<br><br>pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by<br><br>elbowed lances of fire.<br><br><br><br>Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry<br><br>off the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea<br><br>some ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the<br><br>water.  But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth,<br><br>that its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if<br><br>kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps,<br><br>besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more<br><br>or less impeding the vessel's way in the water; because of all this,<br><br>the lower parts of a ship's lightning-rods are not always overboard;<br><br>but are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more<br><br>readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the<br><br>sea, as occasion may require.<br><br><br><br>"The rods! the rods!" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished<br><br>to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting<br><br>flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post.  "Are they overboard? drop them<br><br>over, fore and aft.  Quick!"<br><br><br><br>"Avast!" cried Ahab; "let's have fair play here, though we be the<br><br>weaker side.  Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and<br><br>Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges!  Let<br><br>them be, sir."<br><br><br><br>"Look aloft!" cried Starbuck.  "The corpusants! the corpusants!<br><br><br><br>All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each<br><br>tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each<br><br>of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air,<br><br>like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.<br><br><br><br>"Blast the boat! let it go!" cried Stubb at this instant, as a<br><br>swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its<br><br>gunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing.<br><br>"Blast it!"--but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes<br><br>caught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried--"The<br><br>corpusants have mercy on us all!"<br><br><br><br>To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance<br><br>of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate<br><br>curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a<br><br>seething sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common<br><br>oath when God's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His<br><br>"Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin" has been woven into the shrouds and the<br><br>cordage.<br><br><br><br>While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from<br><br>the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,<br><br>all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away<br><br>constellation of stars.  Relieved against the ghostly light, the<br><br>gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and<br><br>seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.  The parted<br><br>mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely<br><br>gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by<br><br>the preternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned like Satanic<br><br>blue flames on his body.<br><br><br><br>The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once<br><br>more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall.<br><br>A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against<br><br>some one.  It was Stubb.  "What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy<br><br>cry; it was not the same in the song."<br><br><br><br>"No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I<br><br>hope they will, still.  But do they only have mercy on long<br><br>faces?--have they no bowels for a laugh?  And look ye, Mr.<br><br>Starbuck--but it's too dark to look.  Hear me, then: I take that<br><br>mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are<br><br>rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a' block with sperm-oil,<br><br>d'ye see; and so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like<br><br>sap in a tree.  Yes, our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti<br><br>candles--that's the good promise we saw."<br><br><br><br>At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginning<br><br>to glimmer into sight.  Glancing upwards, he cried: "See! see!" and<br><br>once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed<br><br>redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.<br><br><br><br>"The corpusants have mercy on us all," cried Stubb, again.<br><br><br><br>At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the<br><br>flame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front, but with his head<br><br>bowed away from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging<br><br>rigging, where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number<br><br>of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung<br><br>pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig.<br><br>In various enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or<br><br>running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck;<br><br>but all their eyes upcast.<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye, men!" cried Ahab.  "Look up at it; mark it well; the white<br><br>flame but lights the way to the White Whale!  Hand me those mainmast<br><br>links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against<br><br>it; blood against fire!  So."<br><br><br><br>Then turning--the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his<br><br>foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right<br><br>arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.<br><br><br><br>"Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian<br><br>once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that<br><br>to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and<br><br>I now know that thy right worship is defiance.  To neither love nor<br><br>reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill;<br><br>and all are killed.  No fearless fool now fronts thee.  I own thy<br><br>speechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake<br><br>life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.  In the<br><br>midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.<br><br>Though but a point at best; whencesoe'er I came; wheresoe'er I go;<br><br>yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and<br><br>feels her royal rights.  But war is pain, and hate is woe.  Come in<br><br>thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy<br><br>highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest<br><br>navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that in here that still<br><br>remains indifferent.  Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest<br><br>me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee."<br><br><br><br>[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP<br><br>LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT; AHAB, WITH THE REST,<br><br>CLOSES HIS EYES, HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM.]<br><br><br><br>"I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so?  Nor was it<br><br>wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links.  Thou canst blind; but<br><br>I can then grope.  Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes.  Take<br><br>the homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands.  I would not take<br><br>it.  The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and<br><br>ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some<br><br>stunning ground.  Oh, oh!  Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee.<br><br>Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness<br><br>leaping out of light, leaping out of thee!  The javelins cease; open<br><br>eyes; see, or not?  There burn the flames!  Oh, thou magnanimous! now<br><br>I do glory in my genealogy.  But thou art but my fiery father; my<br><br>sweet mother, I know not.  Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her?<br><br>There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater.  Thou knowest not how<br><br>came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy<br><br>beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun.  I know that of me, which<br><br>thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.  There is some<br><br>unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy<br><br>eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical.  Through thee,<br><br>thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it.  Oh, thou<br><br>foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy<br><br>incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.  Here again with<br><br>haughty agony, I read my sire.  Leap! leap up, and lick the sky!  I<br><br>leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee;<br><br>defyingly I worship thee!"<br><br><br><br>"The boat! the boat!" cried Starbuck, "look at thy boat, old man!"<br><br><br><br>Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly<br><br>lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his<br><br>whale-boat's bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused<br><br>the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb<br><br>there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire.  As the silent<br><br>harpoon burned there like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab<br><br>by the arm--"God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! 'tis an<br><br>ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while<br><br>we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a<br><br>better voyage than this."<br><br><br><br>Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the<br><br>braces--though not a sail was left aloft.  For the moment all the<br><br>aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous<br><br>cry.  But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and<br><br>snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them;<br><br>swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a<br><br>rope's end.  Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from<br><br>the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab<br><br>again spoke:--<br><br><br><br>"All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and<br><br>heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound.  And that<br><br>ye may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow<br><br>out the last fear!"  And with one blast of his breath he extinguished<br><br>the flame.<br><br><br><br>As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood<br><br>of some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render<br><br>it so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for<br><br>thunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab's many of the mariners<br><br>did run from him in a terror of dismay.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 120<br><br><br><br>The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch.<br><br><br><br>AHAB STANDING BY THE HELM.

And how<br><br>long ago is it since you said the very contrary?  Didn't you once say<br><br>that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something<br><br>extra on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with<br><br>powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward?  Stop, now; didn't<br><br>you say so?"<br><br><br><br>"Well, suppose I did?  What then?  I've part changed my flesh since<br><br>that time, why not my mind?  Besides, supposing we ARE loaded with<br><br>powder barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the<br><br>lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here?  Why, my little man,<br><br>you have pretty red hair, but you couldn't get afire now.  Shake<br><br>yourself; you're Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill<br><br>pitchers at your coat collar.  Don't you see, then, that for these<br><br>extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees?<br><br>Here are hydrants, Flask.  But hark, again, and I'll answer ye the<br><br>other thing.  First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor<br><br>here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen.  What's the mighty<br><br>difference between holding a mast's lightning-rod in the storm, and<br><br>standing close by a mast that hasn't got any lightning-rod at all in<br><br>a storm?  Don't you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to<br><br>the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck?  What are you<br><br>talking about, then?  Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and<br><br>Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no more danger then, in my<br><br>poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing<br><br>the seas.  Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every<br><br>man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the<br><br>corner of his hat, like a militia officer's skewered feather, and<br><br>trailing behind like his sash.  Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's<br><br>easy to be sensible; why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can<br><br>be sensible."<br><br><br><br>"I don't know that, Stubb.  You sometimes find it rather hard."<br><br><br><br>"Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible,<br><br>that's a fact.  And I am about drenched with this spray.  Never mind;<br><br>catch the turn there, and pass it.  Seems to me we are lashing down<br><br>these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again.<br><br>Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands<br><br>behind him.  And what big generous hands they are, to be sure.  These<br><br>are your iron fists, hey?  What a hold they have, too!  I wonder,<br><br>Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings<br><br>with an uncommon long cable, though.  There, hammer that knot down,<br><br>and we've done.  So; next to touching land, lighting on deck is the<br><br>most satisfactory.  I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye?<br><br>Thank ye.  They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a<br><br>Long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat.  The<br><br>tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d'ye see.<br><br>Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask.<br><br>No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a<br><br>swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so.  Halloa! whew! there goes<br><br>my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from<br><br>heaven should be so unmannerly!  This is a nasty night, lad."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 122<br><br><br><br>Midnight Aloft.--Thunder and Lightning.<br><br><br><br><br><br>THE MAIN-TOP-SAIL YARD.--TASHTEGO PASSING NEW LASHINGS AROUND IT.<br><br><br><br><br><br>"Um, um, um.

Um, um, um!"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 123<br><br><br><br>The Musket.<br><br><br><br><br><br>During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the<br><br>Pequod's jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to<br><br>the deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had<br><br>been attached to it--for they were slack--because some play to the<br><br>tiller was indispensable.<br><br><br><br>In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed<br><br>shuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the<br><br>needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round.  It was<br><br>thus with the Pequod's; at almost every shock the helmsman had not<br><br>failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon<br><br>the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some<br><br>sort of unwonted emotion.<br><br><br><br>Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through<br><br>the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb--one engaged forward<br><br>and the other aft--the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and<br><br>main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away<br><br>to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are<br><br>cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.<br><br><br><br>The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a<br><br>storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through<br><br>the water with some precision again; and the course--for the present,<br><br>East-south-east--which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more<br><br>given to the helmsman.  For during the violence of the gale, he had<br><br>only steered according to its vicissitudes.  But as he was now<br><br>bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the<br><br>compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round<br><br>astern; aye, the foul breeze became fair!<br><br><br><br>Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of "HO! THE FAIR<br><br>WIND! OH-YE-HO, CHEERLY MEN!" the crew singing for joy, that so<br><br>promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents<br><br>preceding it.<br><br><br><br>In compliance with the standing order of his commander--to report<br><br>immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided<br><br>change in the affairs of the deck,--Starbuck had no sooner trimmed<br><br>the yards to the breeze--however reluctantly and gloomily,--than he<br><br>mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.<br><br><br><br>Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a<br><br>moment.  The cabin lamp--taking long swings this way and that--was<br><br>burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man's<br><br>bolted door,--a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of<br><br>upper panels.  The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a<br><br>certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by<br><br>all the roar of the elements.  The loaded muskets in the rack were<br><br>shiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward<br><br>bulkhead.  Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck's<br><br>heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely<br><br>evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good<br><br>accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.<br><br><br><br>"He would have shot me once," he murmured, "yes, there's the very<br><br>musket that he pointed at me;--that one with the studded stock; let<br><br>me touch it--lift it.  Strange, that I, who have handled so many<br><br>deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now.  Loaded?  I must<br><br>see.  Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;--that's not good.  Best spill<br><br>it?--wait.  I'll cure myself of this.  I'll hold the musket boldly<br><br>while I think.--I come to report a fair wind to him.  But how fair?<br><br>Fair for death and doom,--THAT'S fair for Moby Dick.  It's a fair<br><br>wind that's only fair for that accursed fish.--The very tube he<br><br>pointed at me!--the very one; THIS one--I hold it here; he would have<br><br>killed me with the very thing I handle now.--Aye and he would fain<br><br>kill all his crew.  Does he not say he will not strike his spars to<br><br>any gale?  Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same<br><br>perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the<br><br>error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that<br><br>he would have no lightning-rods?  But shall this crazed old man be<br><br>tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom with<br><br>him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and<br><br>more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm,<br><br>my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way.  If, then, he<br><br>were this instant--put aside, that crime would not be his.  Ha! is he<br><br>muttering in his sleep?  Yes, just there,--in there, he's sleeping.<br><br>Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again.  I can't<br><br>withstand thee, then, old man.  Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not<br><br>entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest.  Flat<br><br>obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest.  Aye,<br><br>and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow; say'st all of us are Ahabs.<br><br>Great God forbid!--But is there no other way? no lawful way?--Make<br><br>him a prisoner to be taken home?  What! hope to wrest this old man's<br><br>living power from his own living hands?  Only a fool would try it.<br><br>Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;<br><br>chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more<br><br>hideous than a caged tiger, then.  I could not endure the sight;<br><br>could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself,<br><br>inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage.<br><br>What, then, remains?  The land is hundreds of leagues away, and<br><br>locked Japan the nearest.  I stand alone here upon an open sea, with<br><br>two oceans and a whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis<br><br>so.--Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be<br><br>murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?--And would I<br><br>be a murderer, then, if"--and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways<br><br>looking, he placed the loaded musket's end against the door.<br><br><br><br>"On this level, Ahab's hammock swings within; his head this way.  A<br><br>touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.--Oh<br><br>Mary!  Mary!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I wake thee not to death, old<br><br>man, who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck's body this day<br><br>week may sink, with all the crew!  Great God, where art Thou?  Shall<br><br>I? shall I?--The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and<br><br>main topsails are reefed and set; she heads her course."<br><br><br><br>"Stern all!  Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!"<br><br><br><br>Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's<br><br>tormented sleep, as if Starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb<br><br>dream to speak.<br><br><br><br>The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against the<br><br>panel; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the<br><br>door, he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.<br><br><br><br>"He's too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and<br><br>tell him.  I must see to the deck here.  Thou know'st what to say."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 124<br><br><br><br>The Needle.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of<br><br>mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod's gurgling track, pushed her<br><br>on like giants' palms outspread.  The strong, unstaggering breeze<br><br>abounded so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the<br><br>whole world boomed before the wind.  Muffled in the full morning<br><br>light, the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of<br><br>his place; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.  Emblazonings,<br><br>as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything.<br><br>The sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with<br><br>light and heat.<br><br><br><br>Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every<br><br>time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he<br><br>turned to eye the bright sun's rays produced ahead; and when she<br><br>profoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun's<br><br>rearward place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his<br><br>undeviating wake.<br><br><br><br>"Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot<br><br>of the sun.  Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun<br><br>to ye!  Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the<br><br>sea!"<br><br><br><br>But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards<br><br>the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.<br><br><br><br>"East-sou-east, sir," said the frightened steersman.<br><br><br><br>"Thou liest!" smiting him with his clenched fist.  "Heading East at<br><br>this hour in the morning, and the sun astern?"<br><br><br><br>Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then<br><br>observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its<br><br>very blinding palpableness must have been the cause.<br><br><br><br>Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one<br><br>glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment<br><br>he almost seemed to stagger.  Standing behind him Starbuck looked,<br><br>and lo! the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as<br><br>infallibly going West.<br><br><br><br>But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the<br><br>old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, "I have it!  It has happened<br><br>before.  Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder turned our<br><br>compasses--that's all.  Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I<br><br>take it."<br><br><br><br>"Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir," said the pale<br><br>mate, gloomily.<br><br><br><br>Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more<br><br>than one case occurred to ships in violent storms.  The magnetic<br><br>energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know,<br><br>essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is<br><br>not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be.  Instances<br><br>where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite<br><br>down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at<br><br>times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being<br><br>annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use<br><br>than an old wife's knitting needle.  But in either case, the needle<br><br>never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or<br><br>lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate<br><br>reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the<br><br>lowermost one inserted into the kelson.<br><br><br><br>Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the<br><br>transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended<br><br>hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the<br><br>needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship's<br><br>course to be changed accordingly.  The yards were hard up; and once<br><br>more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for<br><br>the supposed fair one had only been juggling her.<br><br><br><br>Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said<br><br>nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and<br><br>Flask--who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his<br><br>feelings--likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced.  As for the men, though<br><br>some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their<br><br>fear of Fate.  But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained<br><br>almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a<br><br>certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible<br><br>Ahab's.<br><br><br><br>For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries.  But<br><br>chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper<br><br>sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.<br><br><br><br>"Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot! yesterday I wrecked<br><br>thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me.  So, so.<br><br>But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet.  Mr. Starbuck--a lance<br><br>without a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker's<br><br>needles.  Quick!"<br><br><br><br>Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now<br><br>about to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have<br><br>been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile<br><br>skill, in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses.<br><br>Besides, the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles,<br><br>though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by<br><br>superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.<br><br><br><br>"Men," said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed<br><br>him the things he had demanded, "my men, the thunder turned old<br><br>Ahab's needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his<br><br>own, that will point as true as any."<br><br><br><br>Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as<br><br>this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic<br><br>might follow.  But Starbuck looked away.<br><br><br><br>With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the<br><br>lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade<br><br>him hold it upright, without its touching the deck.  Then, with the<br><br>maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he<br><br>placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly<br><br>hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as<br><br>before.  Then going through some small strange motions with<br><br>it--whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely<br><br>intended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain--he called for<br><br>linen thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two<br><br>reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by<br><br>its middle, over one of the compass-cards.  At first, the steel went<br><br>round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last<br><br>it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching<br><br>for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing<br><br>his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--"Look ye, for yourselves,<br><br>if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone!  The sun is East, and<br><br>that compass swears it!"<br><br><br><br>One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes<br><br>could persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they<br><br>slunk away.<br><br><br><br>In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his<br><br>fatal pride.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 125<br><br><br><br>The Log and Line.<br><br><br><br><br><br>While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the<br><br>log and line had but very seldom been in use.  Owing to a confident<br><br>reliance upon other means of determining the vessel's place, some<br><br>merchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly<br><br>neglect to heave the log; though at the same time, and frequently<br><br>more for form's sake than anything else, regularly putting down upon<br><br>the customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the<br><br>presumed average rate of progression every hour.  It had been thus<br><br>with the Pequod.  The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long<br><br>untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks.  Rains and<br><br>spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all the elements<br><br>had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly.  But heedless of all<br><br>this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,<br><br>not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his<br><br>quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level<br><br>log and line.  The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows<br><br>rolled in riots.<br><br><br><br>"Forward, there!  Heave the log!"<br><br><br><br>Two seamen came.  The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.<br><br>"Take the reel, one of ye, I'll heave."<br><br><br><br>They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship's lee side, where<br><br>the deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping<br><br>into the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.<br><br><br><br>The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting<br><br>handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved,<br><br>so stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced<br><br>to him.<br><br><br><br>Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty<br><br>turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old<br><br>Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to<br><br>speak.<br><br><br><br>"Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have<br><br>spoiled it."<br><br><br><br>"'Twill hold, old gentleman.  Long heat and wet, have they spoiled<br><br>thee?  Thou seem'st to hold.  Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee;<br><br>not thou it."<br><br><br><br>"I hold the spool, sir.  But just as my captain says.  With these<br><br>grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially with a<br><br>superior, who'll ne'er confess."<br><br><br><br>"What's that?  There now's a patched professor in Queen Nature's<br><br>granite-founded College; but methinks he's too subservient.  Where<br><br>wert thou born?"<br><br><br><br>"In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir."<br><br><br><br>"Excellent!  Thou'st hit the world by that."<br><br><br><br>"I know not, sir, but I was born there."<br><br><br><br>"In the Isle of Man, hey?  Well, the other way, it's good.  Here's a<br><br>man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of<br><br>Man; which is sucked in--by what?  Up with the reel!  The dead, blind<br><br>wall butts all inquiring heads at last.  Up with it!  So."<br><br><br><br>The log was heaved.  The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a<br><br>long dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to<br><br>whirl.  In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows,<br><br>the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger<br><br>strangely.<br><br><br><br>"Hold hard!"<br><br><br><br>Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the<br><br>tugging log was gone.<br><br><br><br>"I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad<br><br>sea parts the log-line.  But Ahab can mend all.  Haul in here,<br><br>Tahitian; reel up, Manxman.  And look ye, let the carpenter make<br><br>another log, and mend thou the line.  See to it."<br><br><br><br>"There he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me, the skewer<br><br>seems loosening out of the middle of the world.  Haul in, haul in,<br><br>Tahitian!  These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken,<br><br>and dragging slow.  Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?"<br><br><br><br>"Pip? whom call ye Pip?  Pip jumped from the whale-boat.  Pip's<br><br>missing.  Let's see now if ye haven't fished him up here, fisherman.<br><br>It drags hard; I guess he's holding on.  Jerk him, Tahiti!  Jerk him<br><br>off; we haul in no cowards here.  Ho! there's his arm just breaking<br><br>water.  A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off--we haul in no cowards here.<br><br>Captain Ahab! sir, sir! here's Pip, trying to get on board again."<br><br><br><br>"Peace, thou crazy loon," cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.<br><br>"Away from the quarter-deck!"<br><br><br><br>"The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser," muttered Ahab, advancing.<br><br>"Hands off from that holiness!  Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?<br><br><br><br>"Astern there, sir, astern!  Lo! lo!"<br><br><br><br>"And who art thou, boy?  I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils<br><br>of thy eyes.  Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls<br><br>to sieve through!  Who art thou, boy?"<br><br><br><br>"Bell-boy, sir; ship's-crier; ding, dong, ding!  Pip!  Pip!  Pip!  One<br><br>hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high--looks<br><br>cowardly--quickest known by that!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's seen Pip<br><br>the coward?"<br><br><br><br>"There can be no hearts above the snow-line.  Oh, ye frozen heavens!<br><br>look down here.  Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned<br><br>him, ye creative libertines.  Here, boy; Ahab's cabin shall be Pip's<br><br>home henceforth, while Ahab lives.  Thou touchest my inmost centre,<br><br>boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings.  Come,<br><br>let's down."<br><br><br><br>"What's this? here's velvet shark-skin," intently gazing at Ahab's<br><br>hand, and feeling it.  "Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a<br><br>thing as this, perhaps he had ne'er been lost!  This seems to me,<br><br>sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by.  Oh, sir,<br><br>let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black<br><br>one with the white, for I will not let this go."<br><br><br><br>"Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse<br><br>horrors than are here.  Come, then, to my cabin.  Lo! ye believers in<br><br>gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient<br><br>gods oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing<br><br>not what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude.<br><br>Come!  I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I<br><br>grasped an Emperor's!"<br><br><br><br>"There go two daft ones now," muttered the old Manxman.  "One daft<br><br>with strength, the other daft with weakness.  But here's the end of<br><br>the rotten line--all dripping, too.  Mend it, eh?  I think we had<br><br>best have a new line altogether.  I'll see Mr. Stubb about it."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 126<br><br><br><br>The Life-Buoy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel, and her<br><br>progress solely determined by Ahab's level log and line; the Pequod<br><br>held on her path towards the Equator.  Making so long a passage<br><br>through such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long,<br><br>sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously<br><br>mild; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous<br><br>and desperate scene.<br><br><br><br>At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the<br><br>Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before<br><br>the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch--then<br><br>headed by Flask--was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and<br><br>unearthly--like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all<br><br>Herod's murdered Innocents--that one and all, they started from their<br><br>reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned<br><br>all transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that<br><br>wild cry remained within hearing.  The Christian or civilized part of<br><br>the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan<br><br>harpooneers remained unappalled.  Yet the grey Manxman--the oldest<br><br>mariner of all--declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were<br><br>heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.<br><br><br><br>Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when<br><br>he came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not<br><br>unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings.  He hollowly laughed, and<br><br>thus explained the wonder.<br><br><br><br>Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great<br><br>numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or<br><br>some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and<br><br>kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of<br><br>wail.  But this only the more affected some of them, because most<br><br>mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising<br><br>not only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from<br><br>the human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen<br><br>peeringly uprising from the water alongside.  In the sea, under<br><br>certain circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for<br><br>men.<br><br><br><br>But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible<br><br>confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning.  At<br><br>sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;<br><br>and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for<br><br>sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was<br><br>thus with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may,<br><br>he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry and a<br><br>rushing--and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and<br><br>looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of<br><br>the sea.<br><br><br><br>The life-buoy--a long slender cask--was dropped from the stern, where<br><br>it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to<br><br>seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had<br><br>shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also<br><br>filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed<br><br>the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in<br><br>sooth but a hard one.<br><br><br><br>And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look<br><br>out for the White Whale, on the White Whale's own peculiar ground;<br><br>that man was swallowed up in the deep.  But few, perhaps, thought of<br><br>that at the time.  Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at<br><br>this event, at least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a<br><br>foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an<br><br>evil already presaged.  They declared that now they knew the reason<br><br>of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before.  But again the<br><br>old Manxman said nay.<br><br><br><br>The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to<br><br>see to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and<br><br>as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of<br><br>the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was<br><br>directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to<br><br>be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided<br><br>with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg<br><br>hinted a hint concerning his coffin.<br><br><br><br>"A life-buoy of a coffin!" cried Starbuck, starting.<br><br><br><br>"Rather queer, that, I should say," said Stubb.<br><br><br><br>"It will make a good enough one," said Flask, "the carpenter here can<br><br>arrange it easily."<br><br><br><br>"Bring it up; there's nothing else for it," said Starbuck, after a<br><br>melancholy pause.  "Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so--the<br><br>coffin, I mean.  Dost thou hear me?  Rig it."<br><br><br><br>"And shall I nail down the lid, sir?" moving his hand as with a<br><br>hammer.<br><br><br><br>"Aye."<br><br><br><br>"And shall I caulk the seams, sir?" moving his hand as with a<br><br>caulking-iron.<br><br><br><br>"Aye."<br><br><br><br>"And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?" moving his hand<br><br>as with a pitch-pot.<br><br><br><br>"Away! what possesses thee to this?  Make a life-buoy of the coffin,<br><br>and no more.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me."<br><br><br><br>"He goes off in a huff.  The whole he can endure; at the parts he<br><br>baulks.  Now I don't like this.  I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and<br><br>he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and<br><br>he won't put his head into it.  Are all my pains to go for nothing<br><br>with that coffin?  And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it.<br><br>It's like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other<br><br>side now.  I don't like this cobbling sort of business--I don't like<br><br>it at all; it's undignified; it's not my place.  Let tinkers' brats<br><br>do tinkerings; we are their betters.  I like to take in hand none but<br><br>clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that<br><br>regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway,<br><br>and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler's job, that's at<br><br>an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end.  It's the old<br><br>woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.  Lord! what an affection<br><br>all old women have for tinkers.  I know an old woman of sixty-five<br><br>who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once.  And that's the<br><br>reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I<br><br>kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their<br><br>lonely old heads to run off with me.  But heigh-ho! there are no caps<br><br>at sea but snow-caps.  Let me see.  Nail down the lid; caulk the<br><br>seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang<br><br>it with the snap-spring over the ship's stern.  Were ever such things<br><br>done before with a coffin?  Some superstitious old carpenters, now,<br><br>would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job.  But I'm<br><br>made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don't budge.  Cruppered with a<br><br>coffin!  Sailing about with a grave-yard tray!  But never mind.  We<br><br>workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as<br><br>coffins and hearses.  We work by the month, or by the job, or by the<br><br>profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless<br><br>it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can.  Hem!<br><br>I'll do the job, now, tenderly.  I'll have me--let's see--how many in<br><br>the ship's company, all told?  But I've forgotten.  Any way, I'll<br><br>have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed life-lines, each three feet<br><br>long hanging all round to the coffin.  Then, if the hull go down,<br><br>there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a<br><br>sight not seen very often beneath the sun!  Come hammer,<br><br>caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike!  Let's to it."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 127<br><br><br><br>The Deck.<br><br><br><br><br><br>THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE-TUBS, BETWEEN THE VICE-BENCH AND THE<br><br>OPEN HATCHWAY; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS; THE STRING OF<br><br>TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE<br><br>BOSOM OF HIS FROCK.--AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN-GANGWAY, AND<br><br>HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently.  He goes!  Not this<br><br>hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy.--Middle<br><br>aisle of a church!  What's here?"<br><br><br><br>"Life-buoy, sir.  Mr. Starbuck's orders.  Oh, look, sir!  Beware the<br><br>hatchway!"<br><br><br><br>"Thank ye, man.  Thy coffin lies handy to the vault."<br><br><br><br>"Sir?  The hatchway? oh!  So it does, sir, so it does."<br><br><br><br>"Art not thou the leg-maker?  Look, did not this stump come from thy<br><br>shop?"<br><br><br><br>"I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?"<br><br><br><br>"Well enough.  But art thou not also the undertaker?"<br><br><br><br>"Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but<br><br>they've set me now to turning it into something else."<br><br><br><br>"Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,<br><br>monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and<br><br>the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of<br><br>those same coffins?  Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as<br><br>much of a jack-of-all-trades."<br><br><br><br>"But I do not mean anything, sir.  I do as I do."<br><br><br><br>"The gods again.  Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a<br><br>coffin?  The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the<br><br>craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade<br><br>in hand.  Dost thou never?"<br><br><br><br>"Sing, sir?  Do I sing?  Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that;<br><br>but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because<br><br>there was none in his spade, sir.  But the caulking mallet is full of<br><br>it.  Hark to it."<br><br><br><br>"Aye, and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board; and what<br><br>in all things makes the sounding-board is this--there's naught<br><br>beneath.  And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the<br><br>same, Carpenter.  Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the<br><br>coffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?<br><br><br><br>"Faith, sir, I've--"<br><br><br><br>"Faith?  What's that?"<br><br><br><br>"Why, faith, sir, it's only a sort of exclamation-like--that's all,<br><br>sir."<br><br><br><br>"Um, um; go on."<br><br><br><br>"I was about to say, sir, that--"<br><br><br><br>"Art thou a silk-worm?  Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?<br><br>Look at thy bosom!  Despatch! and get these traps out of sight."<br><br><br><br>"He goes aft.  That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot<br><br>latitudes.  I've heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the<br><br>Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle.  Seems to me<br><br>some sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle.<br><br>He's always under the Line--fiery hot, I tell ye!  He's looking this<br><br>way--come, oakum; quick.  Here we go again.  This wooden mallet is<br><br>the cork, and I'm the professor of musical glasses--tap, tap!"<br><br><br><br>(AHAB TO HIMSELF.)<br><br><br><br>"There's a sight!  There's a sound!  The grey-headed woodpecker<br><br>tapping the hollow tree!  Blind and dumb might well be envied now.<br><br>See! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines.  A most<br><br>malicious wag, that fellow.  Rat-tat!  So man's seconds tick!  Oh!<br><br>how immaterial are all materials!  What things real are there, but<br><br>imponderable thoughts?  Here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim<br><br>death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope<br><br>of most endangered life.  A life-buoy of a coffin!  Does it go<br><br>further?  Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after<br><br>all, but an immortality-preserver!  I'll think of that.  But no.  So<br><br>far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the<br><br>theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me.  Will ye<br><br>never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound?  I go below;<br><br>let me not see that thing here when I return again.  Now, then, Pip,<br><br>we'll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee!<br><br>Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 128<br><br><br><br>The Pequod Meets The Rachel.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly<br><br>down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men.  At<br><br>the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as<br><br>the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful<br><br>sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all<br><br>life fled from the smitten hull.<br><br><br><br>"Bad news; she brings bad news," muttered the old Manxman.  But ere<br><br>her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere<br><br>he could hopefully hail, Ahab's voice was heard.<br><br><br><br>"Hast seen the White Whale?"<br><br><br><br>"Aye, yesterday.  Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?"<br><br><br><br>Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected<br><br>question; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the<br><br>stranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel's way, was seen<br><br>descending her side.  A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon<br><br>clinched the Pequod's main-chains, and he sprang to the deck.<br><br>Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew.  But<br><br>no formal salutation was exchanged.<br><br><br><br>"Where was he?--not killed!--not killed!" cried Ahab, closely<br><br>advancing.  "How was it?"<br><br><br><br>It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,<br><br>while three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal of<br><br>whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and<br><br>while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and<br><br>head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very<br><br>far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat--a reserved<br><br>one--had been instantly lowered in chase.  After a keen sail before<br><br>the wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest keeled of all--seemed to<br><br>have succeeded in fastening--at least, as well as the man at the<br><br>mast-head could tell anything about it.  In the distance he saw the<br><br>diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white<br><br>water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the<br><br>stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as<br><br>often happens.  There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm,<br><br>as yet.  The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came<br><br>on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats--ere going<br><br>in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction--the<br><br>ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate<br><br>till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from<br><br>it.  But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded<br><br>all sail--stunsail on stunsail--after the missing boat; kindling a<br><br>fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the<br><br>look-out.  But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance<br><br>to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though<br><br>she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and<br><br>not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered<br><br>her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight;<br><br>yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.<br><br><br><br>The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal<br><br>his object in boarding the Pequod.  He desired that ship to unite<br><br>with his own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five<br><br>miles apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as<br><br>it were.<br><br><br><br>"I will wager something now," whispered Stubb to Flask, "that some<br><br>one in that missing boat wore off that Captain's best coat; mayhap,<br><br>his watch--he's so cursed anxious to get it back.  Who ever heard of<br><br>two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the<br><br>height of the whaling season?  See, Flask, only see how pale he<br><br>looks--pale in the very buttons of his eyes--look--it wasn't the<br><br>coat--it must have been the--"<br><br><br><br>"My boy, my own boy is among them.  For God's sake--I beg, I<br><br>conjure"--here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far<br><br>had but icily received his petition.  "For eight-and-forty hours let<br><br>me charter your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for<br><br>it--if there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only<br><br>that--you must, oh, you must, and you SHALL do this thing."<br><br><br><br>"His son!" cried Stubb, "oh, it's his son he's lost!  I take back the<br><br>coat and watch--what says Ahab?  We must save that boy."<br><br><br><br>"He's drowned with the rest on 'em, last night," said the old Manx<br><br>sailor standing behind them; "I heard; all of ye heard their<br><br>spirits."<br><br><br><br>Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the<br><br>Rachel's the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was<br><br>one of the Captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's<br><br>crew; but among the number of the other boat's crews, at the same<br><br>time, but on the other hand, separated from the ship during the dark<br><br>vicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son; as that<br><br>for a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the<br><br>cruellest perplexity; which was only solved for him by his chief<br><br>mate's instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship<br><br>in such emergencies, that is, when placed between jeopardized but<br><br>divided boats, always to pick up the majority first.  But the<br><br>captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from<br><br>mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab's iciness did<br><br>he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years<br><br>old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a<br><br>Nantucketer's paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in<br><br>the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny<br><br>of all his race.  Nor does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket<br><br>captains will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a<br><br>protracted three or four years' voyage in some other ship than their<br><br>own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall be<br><br>unenervated by any chance display of a father's natural but untimely<br><br>partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.<br><br><br><br>Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of<br><br>Ahab; and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but<br><br>without the least quivering of his own.<br><br><br><br>"I will not go," said the stranger, "till you say aye to me.  Do to<br><br>me as you would have me do to you in the like case.  For YOU too have<br><br>a boy, Captain Ahab--though but a child, and nestling safely at home<br><br>now--a child of your old age too--Yes, yes, you relent; I see<br><br>it--run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards."<br><br><br><br>"Avast," cried Ahab--"touch not a rope-yarn"; then in a voice that<br><br>prolongingly moulded every word--"Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.<br><br>Even now I lose time.  Good-bye, good-bye.  God bless ye, man, and<br><br>may I forgive myself, but I must go.  Mr. Starbuck, look at the<br><br>binnacle watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn<br><br>off all strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail<br><br>as before."<br><br><br><br>Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,<br><br>leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and<br><br>utter rejection of his so earnest suit.  But starting from his<br><br>enchantment, Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than<br><br>stepped into his boat, and returned to his ship.<br><br><br><br>Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange<br><br>vessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every<br><br>dark spot, however small, on the sea.  This way and that her yards<br><br>were swung round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack;<br><br>now she beat against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it;<br><br>while all the while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with<br><br>men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among<br><br>the boughs.<br><br><br><br>But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly<br><br>saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without<br><br>comfort.

But here I'll stay, though this stern<br><br>strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to join me."<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 130<br><br><br><br>The Hat.<br><br><br><br><br><br>And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a<br><br>preliminary cruise, Ahab,--all other whaling waters swept--seemed to<br><br>have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely<br><br>there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and<br><br>longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a<br><br>vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually<br><br>encountered Moby Dick;--and now that all his successive meetings with<br><br>various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac<br><br>indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether<br><br>sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something<br><br>in the old man's eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble<br><br>souls to see.  As the unsetting polar star, which through the<br><br>livelong, arctic, six months' night sustains its piercing, steady,<br><br>central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the<br><br>constant midnight of the gloomy crew.  It domineered above them so,<br><br>that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide<br><br>beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.<br><br><br><br>In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,<br><br>vanished.  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more<br><br>strove to check one.  Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed<br><br>ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped<br><br>mortar of Ahab's iron soul.  Like machines, they dumbly moved about<br><br>the deck, ever conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them.<br><br><br><br>But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours;<br><br>when he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have<br><br>seen that even as Ahab's eyes so awed the crew's, the inscrutable<br><br>Parsee's glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at<br><br>times affected it.  Such an added, gliding strangeness began to<br><br>invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him;<br><br>that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed,<br><br>whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow<br><br>cast upon the deck by some unseen being's body.  And that shadow was<br><br>always hovering there.  For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever<br><br>certainly been known to slumber, or go below.  He would stand still<br><br>for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did<br><br>plainly say--We two watchmen never rest.<br><br><br><br>Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon<br><br>the deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his<br><br>pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating<br><br>limits,--the main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing<br><br>in the cabin-scuttle,--his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if<br><br>to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however<br><br>motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that<br><br>he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching<br><br>hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes<br><br>were really closed at times; or whether he was still intently<br><br>scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a<br><br>whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in<br><br>beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat.  The clothes that<br><br>the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried upon him; and so,<br><br>day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the<br><br>planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.<br><br><br><br>He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast<br><br>and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which<br><br>darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over,<br><br>which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper<br><br>verdure.  But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck;<br><br>and though the Parsee's mystic watch was without intermission as his<br><br>own; yet these two never seemed to speak--one man to the<br><br>other--unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made<br><br>it necessary.  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the<br><br>twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like<br><br>asunder.  If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb<br><br>men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange.<br><br>At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far<br><br>parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the<br><br>mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the<br><br>Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his<br><br>abandoned substance.<br><br><br><br>And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,<br><br>and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--Ahab<br><br>seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave.  Still again<br><br>both seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the<br><br>lean shade siding the solid rib.  For be this Parsee what he may, all<br><br>rib and keel was solid Ahab.<br><br><br><br>At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was<br><br>heard from aft,--"Man the mast-heads!"--and all through the day,<br><br>till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at<br><br>the striking of the helmsman's bell, was heard--"What d'ye<br><br>see?--sharp! sharp!"<br><br><br><br>But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the<br><br>children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the<br><br>monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity; at<br><br>least, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to<br><br>doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the<br><br>sight he sought.  But if these suspicions were really his, he<br><br>sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his<br><br>actions might seem to hint them.<br><br><br><br>"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,"--he said.  "Aye!<br><br>Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest<br><br>of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved<br><br>block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of<br><br>the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a<br><br>pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.  This done,<br><br>with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked<br><br>round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his<br><br>glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah;<br><br>and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate,<br><br>said,--"Take the rope, sir--I give it into thy hands, Starbuck."<br><br>Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to<br><br>hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope<br><br>at last; and afterwards stood near it.  And thus, with one hand<br><br>clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for<br><br>miles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and that,--within the<br><br>wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.<br><br><br><br>When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in<br><br>the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea<br><br>is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under<br><br>these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in<br><br>strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.<br><br>Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various<br><br>different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by<br><br>what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these<br><br>ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it<br><br>would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant<br><br>watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew<br><br>be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's<br><br>proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing<br><br>about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who<br><br>had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree<br><br>approaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the<br><br>look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this<br><br>was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his<br><br>whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands.<br><br><br><br>Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten<br><br>minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly<br><br>incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these<br><br>latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his<br><br>head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a<br><br>thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards,<br><br>and went eddying again round his head.<br><br><br><br>But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed<br><br>not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have<br><br>marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost<br><br>the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in<br><br>almost every sight.<br><br><br><br>"Your hat, your hat, sir!" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who<br><br>being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab,<br><br>though somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air<br><br>dividing them.<br><br><br><br>But already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes; the long<br><br>hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away<br><br>with his prize.<br><br><br><br>An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap to<br><br>replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin<br><br>would be king of Rome.  But only by the replacing of the cap was that<br><br>omen accounted good.  Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk<br><br>flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last<br><br>disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute<br><br>black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into<br><br>the sea.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 131<br><br><br><br>The Pequod Meets The Delight.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the<br><br>life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most<br><br>miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried.  As she drew nigh, all<br><br>eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some<br><br>whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine<br><br>feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.<br><br><br><br>Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and<br><br>some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but<br><br>you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the<br><br>peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.<br><br><br><br>"Hast seen the White Whale?"<br><br><br><br>"Look!" replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and<br><br>with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.<br><br><br><br>"Hast killed him?"<br><br><br><br>"The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that," answered the<br><br>other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose<br><br>gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.<br><br><br><br>"Not forged!" and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the crotch,<br><br>Ahab held it out, exclaiming--"Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this<br><br>hand I hold his death!  Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning<br><br>are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place<br><br>behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!"<br><br><br><br>"Then God keep thee, old man--see'st thou that"--pointing to the<br><br>hammock--"I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only<br><br>yesterday; but were dead ere night.  Only THAT one I bury; the rest<br><br>were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb."  Then<br><br>turning to his crew--"Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the<br><br>rail, and lift the body; so, then--Oh!  God"--advancing towards the<br><br>hammock with uplifted hands--"may the resurrection and the life--"<br><br><br><br>"Brace forward!  Up helm!" cried Ahab like lightning to his men.<br><br><br><br>But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the<br><br>sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea;<br><br>not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have<br><br>sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.<br><br><br><br>As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy<br><br>hanging at the Pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief.<br><br><br><br>"Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!" cried a foreboding voice in her wake.<br><br>"In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us<br><br>your taffrail to show us your coffin!"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 132<br><br><br><br>The Symphony.<br><br><br><br><br><br>It was a clear steel-blue day.  The firmaments of air and sea were<br><br>hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air<br><br>was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust<br><br>and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as<br><br>Samson's chest in his sleep.<br><br><br><br>Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,<br><br>unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;<br><br>but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed<br><br>mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,<br><br>troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.<br><br><br><br>But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades<br><br>and shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it<br><br>were, that distinguished them.<br><br><br><br>Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle<br><br>air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom.  And at the<br><br>girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion--most seen<br><br>here at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving<br><br>alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.<br><br><br><br>Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly<br><br>firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in<br><br>the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of<br><br>the morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's<br><br>forehead of heaven.<br><br><br><br>Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure!  Invisible winged<br><br>creatures that frolic all round us!  Sweet childhood of air and sky!<br><br>how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's close-coiled woe!  But so have I<br><br>seen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol<br><br>around their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which<br><br>grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.<br><br><br><br>Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side<br><br>and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze,<br><br>the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity.  But<br><br>the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel,<br><br>for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.  That glad, happy air,<br><br>that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother<br><br>world, so long cruel--forbidding--now threw affectionate arms round<br><br>his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over<br><br>one, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her<br><br>heart to save and to bless.  From beneath his slouched hat Ahab<br><br>dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such<br><br>wealth as that one wee drop.<br><br><br><br>Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the<br><br>side; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless<br><br>sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around.  Careful<br><br>not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and<br><br>stood there.<br><br><br><br>Ahab turned.<br><br><br><br>"Starbuck!"<br><br><br><br>"Sir."<br><br><br><br>"Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky.  On<br><br>such a day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck my first<br><br>whale--a boy-harpooneer of eighteen!  Forty--forty--forty years<br><br>ago!--ago!  Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of<br><br>privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless<br><br>sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty<br><br>years to make war on the horrors of the deep!  Aye and yes, Starbuck,<br><br>out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore.  When I think<br><br>of this life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the<br><br>masoned, walled-town of a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but<br><br>small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without--oh,<br><br>weariness! heaviness!  Guinea-coast slavery of solitary<br><br>command!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so<br><br>keenly known to me before--and how for forty years I have fed upon<br><br>dry salted fare--fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!--when<br><br>the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and<br><br>broken the world's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts--away, whole<br><br>oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and<br><br>sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my<br><br>marriage pillow--wife? wife?--rather a widow with her husband alive!<br><br>Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and<br><br>then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking<br><br>brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously,<br><br>foamingly chased his prey--more a demon than a man!--aye, aye! what a<br><br>forty years' fool--fool--old fool, has old Ahab been!  Why this<br><br>strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the<br><br>iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?  Behold.<br><br>Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one<br><br>poor leg should have been snatched from under me?  Here, brush this<br><br>old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.  Locks so grey did<br><br>never grow but from out some ashes!  But do I look very old, so very,<br><br>very old, Starbuck?  I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as<br><br>though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since<br><br>Paradise.  God!  God!  God!--crack my heart!--stave my<br><br>brain!--mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have<br><br>I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably<br><br>old?  Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human<br><br>eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze<br><br>upon God.  By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the<br><br>magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye.  No, no;<br><br>stay on board, on board!--lower not when I do; when branded Ahab<br><br>gives chase to Moby Dick.  That hazard shall not be thine.  No, no!<br><br>not with the far away home I see in that eye!"<br><br><br><br>"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!<br><br>why should any one give chase to that hated fish!  Away with me! let<br><br>us fly these deadly waters! let us home!  Wife and child, too, are<br><br>Starbuck's--wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow<br><br>youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,<br><br>longing, paternal old age!  Away! let us away!--this instant let me<br><br>alter the course!  How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would<br><br>we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again!  I think, sir, they<br><br>have some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket."<br><br><br><br>"They have, they have.  I have seen them--some summer days in the<br><br>morning.  About this time--yes, it is his noon nap now--the boy<br><br>vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of<br><br>cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come<br><br>back to dance him again."<br><br><br><br>"'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself!  She promised that my boy, every<br><br>morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of<br><br>his father's sail!  Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for<br><br>Nantucket!  Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!<br><br>See, see! the boy's face from the window! the boy's hand on the<br><br>hill!"<br><br><br><br>But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook,<br><br>and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.<br><br><br><br>"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what<br><br>cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor<br><br>commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep<br><br>pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly<br><br>making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst<br><br>not so much as dare?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  Is it I, God, or who, that<br><br>lifts this arm?  But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an<br><br>errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some<br><br>invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one<br><br>small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that<br><br>thinking, does that living, and not I.  By heaven, man, we are turned<br><br>round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the<br><br>handspike.  And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this<br><br>unsounded sea!  Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase<br><br>and fang that flying-fish?  Where do murderers go, man!  Who's to<br><br>doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?  But it is a<br><br>mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as<br><br>if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been making hay<br><br>somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are<br><br>sleeping among the new-mown hay.  Sleeping?  Aye, toil we how we may,<br><br>we all sleep at last on the field.  Sleep?  Aye, and rust amid<br><br>greenness; as last year's scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut<br><br>swaths--Starbuck!"<br><br><br><br>But blanched to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen<br><br>away.<br><br><br><br>Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at<br><br>two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there.  Fedallah was<br><br>motionlessly leaning over the same rail.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 133<br><br><br><br>The Chase--First Day.<br><br><br><br><br><br>That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man--as his wont at<br><br>intervals--stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and<br><br>went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,<br><br>snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing<br><br>nigh to some barbarous isle.  He declared that a whale must be near.<br><br>Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by<br><br>the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any<br><br>mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the<br><br>dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as<br><br>nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be<br><br>slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.<br><br><br><br>The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently<br><br>vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea<br><br>directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the<br><br>pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like<br><br>marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.<br><br><br><br>"Man the mast-heads!  Call all hands!"<br><br><br><br>Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the<br><br>forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps<br><br>that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did<br><br>they appear with their clothes in their hands.<br><br><br><br>"What d'ye see?" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.<br><br><br><br>"Nothing, nothing sir!" was the sound hailing down in reply.<br><br><br><br>"T'gallant sails!--stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!"<br><br><br><br>All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for<br><br>swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they<br><br>were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way<br><br>aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between<br><br>the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in<br><br>the air.  "There she blows!--there she blows!  A hump like a<br><br>snow-hill!  It is Moby Dick!"<br><br><br><br>Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three<br><br>look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous<br><br>whale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had now gained his final<br><br>perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just<br><br>beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's<br><br>head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.  From this height the<br><br>whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea<br><br>revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent<br><br>spout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same<br><br>silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and<br><br>Indian Oceans.<br><br><br><br>"And did none of ye see it before?" cried Ahab, hailing the perched<br><br>men all around him.<br><br><br><br>"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and<br><br>I cried out," said Tashtego.<br><br><br><br>"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate<br><br>reserved the doubloon for me.  I only; none of ye could have raised<br><br>the White Whale first.  There she blows!--there she blows!--there<br><br>she blows!  There again!--there again!" he cried, in long-drawn,<br><br>lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the<br><br>whale's visible jets.  "He's going to sound!  In stunsails!  Down<br><br>top-gallant-sails!  Stand by three boats.  Mr. Starbuck, remember,<br><br>stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!<br><br>So; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no; only black water!<br><br>All ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by!  Lower me, Mr.<br><br>Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!" and he slid through the air<br><br>to the deck.<br><br><br><br>"He is heading straight to leeward, sir," cried Stubb, "right away<br><br>from us; cannot have seen the ship yet."<br><br><br><br>"Be dumb, man!  Stand by the braces!  Hard down the helm!--brace up!<br><br>Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that!  Boats, boats!"<br><br><br><br>Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails<br><br>set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to<br><br>leeward; and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer lit up<br><br>Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.<br><br><br><br>Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the<br><br>sea; but only slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the<br><br>ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves;<br><br>seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.  At length the<br><br>breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his<br><br>entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as<br><br>if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of<br><br>finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of<br><br>the slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft<br><br>Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his<br><br>broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the<br><br>shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into<br><br>the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright<br><br>bubbles arose and danced by his side.  But these were broken again by<br><br>the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,<br><br>alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff<br><br>rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered<br><br>pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at<br><br>intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and<br><br>fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked<br><br>on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.<br><br><br><br>A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,<br><br>invested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away<br><br>with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,<br><br>leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching<br><br>fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not<br><br>Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White<br><br>Whale as he so divinely swam.<br><br><br><br>On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once<br><br>leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale<br><br>shed off enticings.  No wonder there had been some among the hunters<br><br>who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had<br><br>ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the<br><br>vesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou<br><br>glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how<br><br>many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed<br><br>before.<br><br><br><br>And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,<br><br>among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,<br><br>Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of<br><br>his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his<br><br>jaw.  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for<br><br>an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like<br><br>Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes<br><br>in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of<br><br>sight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white<br><br>sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.<br><br><br><br>With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,<br><br>the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's<br><br>reappearance.<br><br><br><br>"An hour," said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he<br><br>gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide<br><br>wooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his<br><br>eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.<br><br>The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.<br><br><br><br>"The birds!--the birds!" cried Tashtego.<br><br><br><br>In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were<br><br>now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began<br><br>fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with<br><br>joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab<br><br>could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down<br><br>and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no<br><br>bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and<br><br>magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly<br><br>revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating<br><br>up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and<br><br>scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the<br><br>blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like<br><br>an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his<br><br>steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous<br><br>apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,<br><br>went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his<br><br>crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.<br><br><br><br>Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,<br><br>its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet<br><br>under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with<br><br>that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted<br><br>himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head<br><br>lengthwise beneath the boat.<br><br><br><br>Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled<br><br>for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner<br><br>of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within<br><br>his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high<br><br>up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The<br><br>bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of<br><br>Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the<br><br>White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her<br><br>mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;<br><br>but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to<br><br>gain the uttermost stern.<br><br><br><br>And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as<br><br>the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and<br><br>from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be<br><br>darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as<br><br>it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a<br><br>quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac<br><br>Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed<br><br>him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with<br><br>all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly<br><br>strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,<br><br>the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and<br><br>snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,<br><br>bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again<br><br>in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated<br><br>aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging<br><br>to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them<br><br>across.<br><br><br><br>At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the<br><br>first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his<br><br>head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment<br><br>his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.<br><br>But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over<br><br>sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;<br><br>spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell<br><br>flat-faced upon the sea.<br><br><br><br>Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little<br><br>distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in<br><br>the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled<br><br>body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or<br><br>more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their<br><br>confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing<br><br>their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the<br><br>but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the<br><br>Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.<br><br><br><br><br><br>*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its<br><br>designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary<br><br>up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called<br><br>pitchpoling, previously described.  By this motion the whale must<br><br>best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling<br><br>him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly<br><br>round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his<br><br>vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more<br><br>deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden<br><br>him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's<br><br>elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in<br><br>the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to<br><br>swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a<br><br>whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed<br><br>bubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat's<br><br>fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the<br><br>clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more<br><br>than enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so<br><br>revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so<br><br>planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he<br><br>seemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,<br><br>unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the<br><br>eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant<br><br>destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that<br><br>case could they themselves hope to escape.  With straining eyes,<br><br>then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose<br><br>centre had now become the old man's head.<br><br><br><br>Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the<br><br>ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon<br><br>the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed<br><br>her!--"Sail on the"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him<br><br>from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.  But struggling out of<br><br>it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he<br><br>shouted,--"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!"<br><br><br><br>The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,<br><br>she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.  As he<br><br>sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.<br><br><br><br>Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white<br><br>brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily<br><br>strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for<br><br>a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one<br><br>trodden under foot of herds of elephants.  Far inland, nameless wails<br><br>came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.<br><br><br><br>But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the<br><br>more abbreviate it.  In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes<br><br>condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains<br><br>kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.  And so, such<br><br>hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods<br><br>decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly<br><br>made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless<br><br>centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of<br><br>inferior souls.<br><br><br><br>"The harpoon," said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on<br><br>one bended arm--"is it safe?"<br><br><br><br>"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it," said Stubb, showing<br><br>it.<br><br><br><br>"Lay it before me;--any missing men?"<br><br><br><br>"One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here<br><br>are five men."<br><br><br><br>"That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand.  So, so, I see him!<br><br>there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--Hands<br><br>off from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again!  Set the<br><br>sail; out oars; the helm!"<br><br><br><br>It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being<br><br>picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the<br><br>chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.  It<br><br>was thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal the<br><br>added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his<br><br>every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if<br><br>now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an<br><br>indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew<br><br>endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining<br><br>at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief<br><br>vicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered<br><br>the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.<br><br>Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to<br><br>their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been<br><br>previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side,<br><br>and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with<br><br>stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod<br><br>bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick.  At the well known,<br><br>methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly<br><br>announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported<br><br>as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the<br><br>deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the<br><br>allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.--"Whose is the doubloon<br><br>now?  D'ye see him?" and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he<br><br>commanded them to lift him to his perch.  In this way the day wore<br><br>on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the<br><br>planks.<br><br><br><br>As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men<br><br>aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to<br><br>a still greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched<br><br>hat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been<br><br>dropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to<br><br>shattered stern.  At last he paused before it; and as in an already<br><br>over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across,<br><br>so over the old man's face there now stole some such added gloom as<br><br>this.<br><br><br><br>Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to<br><br>evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place<br><br>in his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck<br><br>exclaimed--"The thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too<br><br>keenly, sir; ha! ha!"<br><br><br><br>"What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?  Man, man!<br><br>did I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I<br><br>could swear thou wert a poltroon.  Groan nor laugh should be heard<br><br>before a wreck."<br><br><br><br>"Aye, sir," said Starbuck drawing near, "'tis a solemn sight; an<br><br>omen, and an ill one."<br><br><br><br>"Omen? omen?--the dictionary!  If the gods think to speak outright to<br><br>man, they will honourably speak outright; not shake their heads, and<br><br>give an old wives' darkling hint.--Begone!  Ye two are the opposite<br><br>poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is<br><br>Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the<br><br>millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors!  Cold,<br><br>cold--I shiver!--How now?  Aloft there!  D'ye see him?  Sing out for<br><br>every spout, though he spout ten times a second!"<br><br><br><br>The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was<br><br>rustling.  Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still<br><br>remained unset.<br><br><br><br>"Can't see the spout now, sir;--too dark"--cried a voice from the<br><br>air.<br><br><br><br>"How heading when last seen?"<br><br><br><br>"As before, sir,--straight to leeward."<br><br><br><br>"Good! he will travel slower now 'tis night.  Down royals and<br><br>top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck.  We must not run over him<br><br>before morning; he's making a passage now, and may heave-to a while.<br><br>Helm there! keep her full before the wind!--Aloft! come down!--Mr.<br><br>Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned<br><br>till morning."--Then advancing towards the doubloon in the<br><br>main-mast--"Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let<br><br>it abide here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye<br><br>first raises him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that<br><br>man's; and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times<br><br>its sum shall be divided among all of ye!  Away now!--the deck is<br><br>thine, sir!"<br><br><br><br>And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and<br><br>slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals<br><br>rousing himself to see how the night wore on.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 134<br><br><br><br>The Chase--Second Day.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.<br><br><br><br>"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the<br><br>light to spread.<br><br><br><br>"See nothing, sir."<br><br><br><br>"Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought<br><br>for;--the top-gallant sails!--aye, they should have been kept on her<br><br>all night.  But no matter--'tis but resting for the rush."<br><br><br><br>Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular<br><br>whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day,<br><br>is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery.  For<br><br>such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible<br><br>confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the<br><br>Nantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale<br><br>when last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances,<br><br>pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will<br><br>continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his<br><br>probable rate of progression during that period.  And, in these<br><br>cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose<br><br>general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to<br><br>return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands<br><br>by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present<br><br>visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen<br><br>headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his<br><br>compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently<br><br>marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures<br><br>the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost<br><br>as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot's<br><br>coast is to him.  So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the<br><br>proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all<br><br>desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land.  And as<br><br>the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly<br><br>known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time<br><br>his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it,<br><br>the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at<br><br>such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these<br><br>Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the<br><br>observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours<br><br>hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about<br><br>reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude.  But to render<br><br>this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea<br><br>must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail to the<br><br>becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is<br><br>exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port?  Inferable<br><br>from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching<br><br>the chase of whales.<br><br><br><br>The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a<br><br>cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level<br><br>field.<br><br><br><br>"By salt and hemp!" cried Stubb, "but this swift motion of the deck<br><br>creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart.  This ship and I are<br><br>two brave fellows!--Ha, ha!  Some one take me up, and launch me,<br><br>spine-wise, on the sea,--for by live-oaks! my spine's a keel.  Ha,<br><br>ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!"<br><br><br><br>"There she blows--she blows!--she blows!--right ahead!" was now the<br><br>mast-head cry.<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye!" cried Stubb, "I knew it--ye can't escape--blow on and<br><br>split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow<br><br>your trump--blister your lungs!--Ahab will dam off your blood, as a<br><br>miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!"<br><br><br><br>And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew.  The<br><br>frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up,<br><br>like old wine worked anew.  Whatever pale fears and forebodings some<br><br>of them might have felt before; these were not only now kept out of<br><br>sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and<br><br>on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the<br><br>bounding bison.  The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and<br><br>by the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past<br><br>night's suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which<br><br>their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these<br><br>things, their hearts were bowled along.  The wind that made great<br><br>bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as<br><br>irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so<br><br>enslaved them to the race.<br><br><br><br>They were one man, not thirty.  For as the one ship that held them<br><br>all; though it was put together of all contrasting things--oak, and<br><br>maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp--yet all these ran<br><br>into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both<br><br>balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the<br><br>individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt<br><br>and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all<br><br>directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did<br><br>point to.<br><br><br><br>The rigging lived.  The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were<br><br>outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs.  Clinging to a spar with<br><br>one hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings;<br><br>others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on<br><br>the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready<br><br>and ripe for their fate.  Ah! how they still strove through that<br><br>infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!<br><br><br><br>"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?" cried Ahab, when, after<br><br>the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been<br><br>heard.  "Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts<br><br>one odd jet that way, and then disappears."<br><br><br><br>It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken<br><br>some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon<br><br>proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope<br><br>belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an<br><br>orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges<br><br>of rifles.  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard,<br><br>as--much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less<br><br>than a mile ahead--Moby Dick bodily burst into view!  For not by any<br><br>calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic<br><br>fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity;<br><br>but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.  Rising with<br><br>his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus<br><br>booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a<br><br>mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven<br><br>miles and more.  In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes<br><br>off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of<br><br>defiance.<br><br><br><br>"There she breaches! there she breaches!" was the cry, as in his<br><br>immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to<br><br>Heaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved<br><br>against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,<br><br>for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and<br><br>stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling<br><br>intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.<br><br><br><br>"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!" cried Ahab, "thy hour<br><br>and thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at<br><br>the fore.  The boats!--stand by!"<br><br><br><br>Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like<br><br>shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and<br><br>halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped<br><br>from his perch.<br><br><br><br>"Lower away," he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare<br><br>one, rigged the afternoon previous.  "Mr. Starbuck, the ship is<br><br>thine--keep away from the boats, but keep near them.  Lower, all!"<br><br><br><br>As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the<br><br>first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for<br><br>the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he<br><br>told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull<br><br>straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a<br><br>certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the<br><br>whale's sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and<br><br>while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his<br><br>eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in<br><br>an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a<br><br>lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of<br><br>the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on<br><br>annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But<br><br>skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in<br><br>the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by<br><br>a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore<br><br>every other cry but his to shreds.<br><br><br><br>But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed<br><br>and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the<br><br>three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of<br><br>themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in<br><br>him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to<br><br>rally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab<br><br>first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking<br><br>in upon it again--hoping that way to disencumber it of some<br><br>snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of<br><br>sharks!<br><br><br><br>Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose<br><br>harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came<br><br>flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.<br><br>Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically<br><br>reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;<br><br>dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and<br><br>then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the<br><br>intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.<br><br>That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining<br><br>tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the<br><br>more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed<br><br>them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and<br><br>then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,<br><br>in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced<br><br>round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of<br><br>punch.<br><br><br><br>While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out<br><br>after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,<br><br>while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,<br><br>twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and<br><br>Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while<br><br>the old man's line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the<br><br>creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness<br><br>of a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed<br><br>drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting<br><br>perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad<br><br>forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into<br><br>the air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men<br><br>struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.<br><br><br><br>The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as<br><br>he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a<br><br>little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and<br><br>with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his<br><br>flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the<br><br>least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly<br><br>drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if<br><br>satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated<br><br>forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled<br><br>lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.<br><br><br><br>As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again<br><br>came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the<br><br>floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,<br><br>and safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,<br><br>wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;<br><br>inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all<br><br>these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have<br><br>befallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now<br><br>found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half, which afforded a<br><br>comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous<br><br>day's mishap.<br><br><br><br>But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;<br><br>as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the<br><br>shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist<br><br>him.  His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp<br><br>splinter.<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who<br><br>he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has."<br><br><br><br>"The ferrule has not stood, sir," said the carpenter, now coming up;<br><br>"I put good work into that leg."<br><br><br><br>"But no bones broken, sir, I hope," said Stubb with true concern.<br><br><br><br>"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even<br><br>with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living<br><br>bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost.  Nor<br><br>white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his<br><br>own proper and inaccessible being.  Can any lead touch yonder floor,<br><br>any mast scrape yonder roof?--Aloft there! which way?"<br><br><br><br>"Dead to leeward, sir."<br><br><br><br>"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest<br><br>of the spare boats and rig them--Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the<br><br>boat's crews."<br><br><br><br>"Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir."<br><br><br><br>"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!  Accursed fate! that the<br><br>unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!"<br><br><br><br>"Sir?"<br><br><br><br>"My body, man, not thee.  Give me something for a cane--there, that<br><br>shivered lance will do.  Muster the men.  Surely I have not seen him<br><br>yet.  By heaven it cannot be!--missing?--quick! call them all."<br><br><br><br>The old man's hinted thought was true.  Upon mustering the company,<br><br>the Parsee was not there.<br><br><br><br>"The Parsee!" cried Stubb--"he must have been caught in--"<br><br><br><br>"The black vomit wrench thee!--run all of ye above, alow, cabin,<br><br>forecastle--find him--not gone--not gone!"<br><br><br><br>But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was<br><br>nowhere to be found.<br><br><br><br>"Aye, sir," said Stubb--"caught among the tangles of your line--I<br><br>thought I saw him dragging under."<br><br><br><br>"MY line! MY line?  Gone?--gone?  What means that little word?--What<br><br>death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the<br><br>belfry.  The harpoon, too!--toss over the litter there,--d'ye see<br><br>it?--the forged iron, men, the white whale's--no, no, no,--blistered<br><br>fool! this hand did dart it!--'tis in the fish!--Aloft there!  Keep<br><br>him nailed--Quick!--all hands to the rigging of the boats--collect<br><br>the oars--harpooneers! the irons, the irons!--hoist the royals higher--a<br><br>pull on all the sheets!--helm there! steady, steady for your life!<br><br>I'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight<br><br>through it, but I'll slay him yet!<br><br><br><br>"Great God! but for one single instant show thyself," cried Starbuck;<br><br>"never, never wilt thou capture him, old man--In Jesus' name no more<br><br>of this, that's worse than devil's madness.  Two days chased; twice<br><br>stove to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee;<br><br>thy evil shadow gone--all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:--<br><br>what more wouldst thou have?--Shall we keep chasing this murderous<br><br>fish till he swamps the last man?  Shall we be dragged by him to the<br><br>bottom of the sea?  Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?<br><br>Oh, oh,--Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!"<br><br><br><br>"Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that<br><br>hour we both saw--thou know'st what, in one another's eyes.  But in<br><br>this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm<br><br>of this hand--a lipless, unfeatured blank.  Ahab is for ever Ahab,<br><br>man.  This whole act's immutably decreed.  'Twas rehearsed by thee<br><br>and me a billion years before this ocean rolled.  Fool!  I am the<br><br>Fates' lieutenant; I act under orders.  Look thou, underling! that<br><br>thou obeyest mine.--Stand round me, men.  Ye see an old man cut down<br><br>to the stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely<br><br>foot.  'Tis Ahab--his body's part; but Ahab's soul's a centipede,<br><br>that moves upon a hundred legs.  I feel strained, half stranded, as<br><br>ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so.  But<br><br>ere I break, yell hear me crack; and till ye hear THAT, know that<br><br>Ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet.  Believe ye, men, in the things<br><br>called omens?  Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!  For ere they drown,<br><br>drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to<br><br>sink for evermore.  So with Moby Dick--two days he's floated--tomorrow<br><br>will be the third.  Aye, men, he'll rise once more,--but only to<br><br>spout his last!  D'ye feel brave men, brave?"<br><br><br><br>"As fearless fire," cried Stubb.<br><br><br><br>"And as mechanical," muttered Ahab.  Then as the men went forward, he<br><br>muttered on: "The things called omens!  And yesterday I talked the<br><br>same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat.  Oh! how valiantly<br><br>I seek to drive out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in<br><br>mine!--The Parsee--the Parsee!--gone, gone? and he was to go<br><br>before:--but still was to be seen again ere I could perish--How's<br><br>that?--There's a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by<br><br>the ghosts of the whole line of judges:--like a hawk's beak it pecks<br><br>my brain.  I'LL, I'LL solve it, though!"<br><br><br><br>When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.<br><br><br><br>So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as<br><br>on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the<br><br>grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by<br><br>lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and<br><br>sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow.  Meantime, of the<br><br>broken keel of Ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another<br><br>leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed<br><br>within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone<br><br>backward on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 135<br><br><br><br>The Chase.--Third Day.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the<br><br>solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of<br><br>the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.<br><br><br><br>"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.<br><br><br><br>"In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that's all.<br><br>Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.  What a<br><br>lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a<br><br>summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its<br><br>throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.<br><br>Here's food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never<br><br>thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; THAT'S tingling enough for<br><br>mortal man! to think's audacity.  God only has that right and<br><br>privilege.  Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness;<br><br>and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for<br><br>that.  And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm--frozen<br><br>calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents<br><br>turned to ice, and shiver it.  And still this hair is growing now;<br><br>this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it's like that<br><br>sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy<br><br>clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava.  How the wild winds blow<br><br>it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the<br><br>tossed ship they cling to.  A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere<br><br>this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and<br><br>ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.<br><br>Out upon it!--it's tainted.  Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on<br><br>such a wicked, miserable world.  I'd crawl somewhere to a cave, and<br><br>slink there.  And yet, 'tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who<br><br>ever conquered it?  In every fight it has the last and bitterest<br><br>blow.  Run tilting at it, and you but run through it.  Ha! a coward<br><br>wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a<br><br>single blow.  Even Ahab is a braver thing--a nobler thing than THAT.<br><br>Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most<br><br>exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but<br><br>only bodiless as objects, not as agents.  There's a most special, a<br><br>most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference!  And yet, I say again,<br><br>and swear it now, that there's something all glorious and gracious in<br><br>the wind.  These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear<br><br>heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness;<br><br>and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea<br><br>may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and<br><br>swerve about, uncertain where to go at last.  And by the eternal<br><br>Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these<br><br>Trades, or something like them--something so unchangeable, and full<br><br>as strong, blow my keeled soul along!  To it!  Aloft there!  What<br><br>d'ye see?"<br><br><br><br>"Nothing, sir."<br><br><br><br>"Nothing! and noon at hand!  The doubloon goes a-begging!  See the<br><br>sun!  Aye, aye, it must be so.  I've oversailed him.  How, got the<br><br>start?  Aye, he's chasing ME now; not I, HIM--that's bad; I might<br><br>have known it, too.  Fool! the lines--the harpoons he's towing.  Aye,<br><br>aye, I have run him by last night.  About! about!  Come down, all of<br><br>ye, but the regular look outs!  Man the braces!"<br><br><br><br>Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's<br><br>quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the<br><br>braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in<br><br>her own white wake.<br><br><br><br>"Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw," murmured Starbuck<br><br>to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail.<br><br>"God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the<br><br>inside wet my flesh.  I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying<br><br>him!"<br><br><br><br>"Stand by to sway me up!" cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.<br><br>"We should meet him soon."<br><br><br><br>"Aye, aye, sir," and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and<br><br>once more Ahab swung on high.<br><br><br><br>A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages.  Time itself now<br><br>held long breaths with keen suspense.  But at last, some three points<br><br>off the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly<br><br>from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of<br><br>fire had voiced it.<br><br><br><br>"Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick!  On<br><br>deck there!--brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind's eye.  He's<br><br>too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck.  The sails shake!  Stand over<br><br>that helmsman with a top-maul!  So, so; he travels fast, and I must<br><br>down.  But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the<br><br>sea; there's time for that.  An old, old sight, and yet somehow so<br><br>young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from<br><br>the sand-hills of Nantucket!  The same!--the same!--the same to Noah<br><br>as to me.  There's a soft shower to leeward.  Such lovely<br><br>leewardings!  They must lead somewhere--to something else than common<br><br>land, more palmy than the palms.  Leeward! the white whale goes that<br><br>way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter.  But<br><br>good bye, good bye, old mast-head!  What's this?--green? aye, tiny<br><br>mosses in these warped cracks.  No such green weather stains on<br><br>Ahab's head!  There's the difference now between man's old age and<br><br>matter's.  But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our<br><br>hulls, though, are we not, my ship?  Aye, minus a leg, that's all.<br><br>By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way.<br><br>I can't compare with it; and I've known some ships made of dead trees<br><br>outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital<br><br>fathers.  What's that he said? he should still go before me, my<br><br>pilot; and yet to be seen again?  But where?  Will I have eyes at the<br><br>bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all<br><br>night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.  Aye, aye,<br><br>like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself, O<br><br>Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short.  Good-bye,<br><br>mast-head--keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone.  We'll<br><br>talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there,<br><br>tied by head and tail."<br><br><br><br>He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered<br><br>through the cloven blue air to the deck.<br><br><br><br>In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop's<br><br>stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to<br><br>the mate,--who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck--and bade him<br><br>pause.<br><br><br><br>"Starbuck!"<br><br><br><br>"Sir?"<br><br><br><br>"For the third time my soul's ship starts upon this voyage,<br><br>Starbuck."<br><br><br><br>"Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so."<br><br><br><br>"Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,<br><br>Starbuck!"<br><br><br><br>"Truth, sir: saddest truth."<br><br><br><br>"Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the<br><br>flood;--and I feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb,<br><br>Starbuck.  I am old;--shake hands with me, man."<br><br><br><br>Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck's tears the glue.<br><br><br><br>"Oh, my captain, my captain!--noble heart--go not--go not!--see, it's<br><br>a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!"<br><br><br><br>"Lower away!"--cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him.  "Stand<br><br>by the crew!"<br><br><br><br>In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.<br><br><br><br>"The sharks! the sharks!" cried a voice from the low cabin-window<br><br>there; "O master, my master, come back!"<br><br><br><br>But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and<br><br>the boat leaped on.<br><br><br><br>Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship,<br><br>when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters<br><br>beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars,<br><br>every time they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the<br><br>boat with their bites.  It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the<br><br>whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently<br><br>following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the<br><br>banners of marching regiments in the east.  But these were the first<br><br>sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had<br><br>been first descried; and whether it was that Ahab's crew were all<br><br>such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to<br><br>the senses of the sharks--a matter sometimes well known to affect<br><br>them,--however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without<br><br>molesting the others.<br><br><br><br>"Heart of wrought steel!" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and<br><br>following with his eyes the receding boat--"canst thou yet ring<br><br>boldly to that sight?--lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and<br><br>followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical<br><br>third day?--For when three days flow together in one continuous<br><br>intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the<br><br>noon, and the third the evening and the end of that thing--be that<br><br>end what it may.  Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me,<br><br>and leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant,--fixed at the top of a<br><br>shudder!  Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines and<br><br>skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.  Mary, girl! thou<br><br>fadest in pale glories behind me; boy!  I seem to see but thy eyes<br><br>grown wondrous blue.  Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but<br><br>clouds sweep between--Is my journey's end coming?  My legs feel<br><br>faint; like his who has footed it all day.  Feel thy heart,--beats<br><br>it yet?  Stir thyself, Starbuck!--stave it off--move, move! speak<br><br>aloud!--Mast-head there!  See ye my boy's hand on the<br><br>hill?--Crazed;--aloft there!--keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:--<br><br>mark well the whale!--Ho! again!--drive off that hawk! see! he<br><br>pecks--he tears the vane"--pointing to the red flag flying at the<br><br>main-truck--"Ha! he soars away with it!--Where's the old man now?<br><br>see'st thou that sight, oh Ahab!--shudder, shudder!"<br><br><br><br>The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the<br><br>mast-heads--a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had<br><br>sounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on<br><br>his way a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew<br><br>maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered<br><br>and hammered against the opposing bow.<br><br><br><br>"Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads<br><br>drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and<br><br>no hearse can be mine:--and hemp only can kill me!  Ha! ha!"<br><br><br><br>Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then<br><br>quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of<br><br>ice, swiftly rising to the surface.  A low rumbling sound was heard;<br><br>a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled<br><br>with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot<br><br>lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping<br><br>veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then<br><br>fell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the<br><br>waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly<br><br>sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like<br><br>new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.<br><br><br><br>"Give way!" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward<br><br>to the attack; but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded<br><br>in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that<br><br>fell from heaven.  The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his<br><br>broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted<br><br>together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and<br><br>once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from<br><br>the two mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of<br><br>their bows, but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.<br><br><br><br>While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as<br><br>the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank<br><br>as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up.  Lashed<br><br>round and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns<br><br>in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions<br><br>of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen;<br><br>his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full<br><br>upon old Ahab.<br><br><br><br>The harpoon dropped from his hand.<br><br><br><br>"Befooled, befooled!"--drawing in a long lean breath--"Aye, Parsee!<br><br>I see thee again.--Aye, and thou goest before; and this, THIS then is<br><br>the hearse that thou didst promise.  But I hold thee to the last<br><br>letter of thy word.  Where is the second hearse?  Away, mates, to the<br><br>ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and<br><br>return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die--Down, men! the first<br><br>thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I<br><br>harpoon.  Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey<br><br>me.--Where's the whale? gone down again?"<br><br><br><br>But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with<br><br>the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last<br><br>encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was<br><br>now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the<br><br>ship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to<br><br>him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.  He seemed<br><br>swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing<br><br>his own straight path in the sea.<br><br><br><br>"Oh!  Ahab," cried Starbuck, "not too late is it, even now, the third<br><br>day, to desist.  See!  Moby Dick seeks thee not.  It is thou, thou,<br><br>that madly seekest him!"<br><br><br><br>Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled<br><br>to leeward, by both oars and canvas.  And at last when Ahab was<br><br>sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's<br><br>face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel<br><br>about, and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.<br><br>Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly<br><br>mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in<br><br>the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and<br><br>were busily at work in repairing them.  One after the other, through<br><br>the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb<br><br>and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and<br><br>lances.  As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken<br><br>boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.  But<br><br>he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the<br><br>main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that<br><br>perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and<br><br>so nail it to the mast.<br><br><br><br>Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance<br><br>to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some<br><br>latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White<br><br>Whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so<br><br>rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start<br><br>had not been so long a one as before.  And still as Ahab glided over<br><br>the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously<br><br>stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that<br><br>the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in<br><br>the sea, at almost every dip.<br><br><br><br>"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.  Pull<br><br>on! 'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the yielding water."<br><br><br><br>"But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!"<br><br><br><br>"They will last long enough! pull on!--But who can tell"--he<br><br>muttered--"whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on<br><br>Ahab?--But pull on!  Aye, all alive, now--we near him.  The helm!<br><br>take the helm! let me pass,"--and so saying two of the oarsmen helped<br><br>him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.<br><br><br><br>At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along<br><br>with the White Whale's flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its<br><br>advance--as the whale sometimes will--and Ahab was fairly within the<br><br>smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled<br><br>round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,<br><br>with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the<br><br>poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the<br><br>hated whale.  As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if<br><br>sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically<br><br>rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in<br><br>it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the<br><br>elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once<br><br>more have been tossed into the sea.  As it was, three of the<br><br>oarsmen--who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were<br><br>therefore unprepared for its effects--these were flung out; but so<br><br>fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and<br><br>rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily<br><br>inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still<br><br>afloat and swimming.<br><br><br><br>Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,<br><br>instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering<br><br>sea.  But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with<br><br>the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on<br><br>their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the<br><br>treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the<br><br>empty air!<br><br><br><br>"What breaks in me?  Some sinew cracks!--'tis whole again; oars!<br><br>oars!  Burst in upon him!"<br><br><br><br>Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale<br><br>wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that<br><br>evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;<br><br>seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking<br><br>it--it may be--a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down<br><br>upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.<br><br><br><br>Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead.  "I grow blind; hands!<br><br>stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way.  Is't night?"<br><br><br><br>"The whale!  The ship!" cried the cringing oarsmen.<br><br><br><br>"Oars! oars!  Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be<br><br>for ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his<br><br>mark!  I see: the ship! the ship!  Dash on, my men!  Will ye not<br><br>save my ship?"<br><br><br><br>But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the<br><br>sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two<br><br>planks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily<br><br>disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading,<br><br>splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring<br><br>water.<br><br><br><br>Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer<br><br>remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him<br><br>as with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his<br><br>own forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon<br><br>the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as<br><br>soon as he.<br><br><br><br>"The whale, the whale!  Up helm, up helm!  Oh, all ye sweet powers of<br><br>air, now hug me close!  Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a<br><br>woman's fainting fit.  Up helm, I say--ye fools, the jaw! the jaw!<br><br>Is this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long<br><br>fidelities?  Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work.  Steady! helmsman, steady.<br><br>Nay, nay!  Up helm again!  He turns to meet us!  Oh, his<br><br>unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he<br><br>cannot depart.  My God, stand by me now!"<br><br><br><br>"Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now<br><br>help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here.  I grin at thee, thou<br><br>grinning whale!  Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but<br><br>Stubb's own unwinking eye?  And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a<br><br>mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood!<br><br>I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!  Look ye, sun, moon, and stars!<br><br>I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.<br><br>For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand<br><br>the cup!  Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there'll be plenty<br><br>of gulping soon!  Why fly ye not, O Ahab!  For me, off shoes and<br><br>jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers!  A most mouldy and over<br><br>salted death, though;--cherries! cherries! cherries!  Oh, Flask, for<br><br>one red cherry ere we die!"<br><br><br><br>"Cherries?  I only wish that we were where they grow.  Oh, Stubb, I<br><br>hope my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers<br><br>will now come to her, for the voyage is up."<br><br><br><br>From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive;<br><br>hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained<br><br>in their hands, just as they had darted from their various<br><br>employments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which<br><br>from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a<br><br>broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he<br><br>rushed.  Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his<br><br>whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid<br><br>white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's starboard bow, till<br><br>men and timbers reeled.  Some fell flat upon their faces.  Like<br><br>dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their<br><br>bull-like necks.  Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as<br><br>mountain torrents down a flume.<br><br><br><br>"The ship!  The hearse!--the second hearse!" cried Ahab from the<br><br>boat; "its wood could only be American!"<br><br><br><br>Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its<br><br>keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far<br><br>off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where, for<br><br>a time, he lay quiescent.<br><br><br><br>"I turn my body from the sun.  What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy<br><br>hammer.  Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked<br><br>keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm,<br><br>and Pole-pointed prow,--death-glorious ship! must ye then perish,<br><br>and without me?  Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest<br><br>shipwrecked captains?  Oh, lonely death on lonely life!  Oh, now I<br><br>feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief.  Ho, ho! from all<br><br>your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole<br><br>foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death!  Towards<br><br>thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last<br><br>I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's<br><br>sake I spit my last breath at thee.  Sink all coffins and all hearses<br><br>to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to<br><br>pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned<br><br>whale!  THUS, I give up the spear!"<br><br><br><br>The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with<br><br>igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves;--ran foul.  Ahab<br><br>stooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him<br><br>round the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their<br><br>victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.<br><br>Next instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out<br><br>of the stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea,<br><br>disappeared in its depths.<br><br><br><br>For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still; then turned.<br><br>"The ship?  Great God, where is the ship?"  Soon they through dim,<br><br>bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the<br><br>gaseous Fata Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while<br><br>fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty<br><br>perches, the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking<br><br>lookouts on the sea.  And now, concentric circles seized the lone<br><br>boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every<br><br>lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round<br><br>in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.<br><br><br><br>But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the<br><br>sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of<br><br>the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the<br><br>flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the<br><br>destroying billows they almost touched;--at that instant, a red arm<br><br>and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act<br><br>of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.  A<br><br>sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from<br><br>its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and<br><br>incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its<br><br>broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and<br><br>simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage<br><br>beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the<br><br>bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak<br><br>thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of<br><br>Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to<br><br>hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and<br><br>helmeted herself with it.<br><br><br><br>Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen<br><br>white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the<br><br>great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years<br><br>ago.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Epilogue<br><br><br><br>"AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE"<br><br>Job.<br><br><br><br>The drama's done.  Why then here does any one step forth?--Because<br><br>one did survive the wreck.<br><br><br><br>It so chanced, that after the Parsee's disappearance, I was he whom<br><br>the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bowsman, when that<br><br>bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day<br><br>the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped<br><br>astern.  So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full<br><br>sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me,<br><br>I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex.  When I<br><br>reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool.  Round and round, then,<br><br>and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis<br><br>of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve.<br><br>Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and<br><br>now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its<br><br>great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot<br><br>lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.  Buoyed<br><br>up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a<br><br>soft and dirgelike main.  The unharming sharks, they glided by as if<br><br>with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with<br><br>sheathed beaks.  On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and<br><br>picked me up at last.  It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in<br><br>her retracing search after her missing children, only found another<br><br>orphan.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>End of this Project Gutenberg etext of Moby Dick, by Herman Melville<br><br><br><br>
